id=\"weapon-and-armor-proficiency\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3><p>Chemists are proficient with all simple weapons, simple firearms, and bombs. Chemists are proficient with light armor, but not with any type of shields.</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the chemist receives the Limit Breaks (Mega-Item and Perfect Bomb).</p><p><em>Mega-Item (Su):</em> This Limit Break transforms an alchemical item into a very potent version. All variable, numeric effects are maximized. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four chemist levels after 1st, the chemist can create one of these items. They last for the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four chemists levels after 1st before it lose all potency. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><p><em>Perfect Bomb (Su):</em> This Limit Break allows the chemist to create the perfect bomb. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four chemist levels after 1st, the chemist creates one of these bombs which he can throw at double the normal range and deals maximum damage. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><h3 id=\"bomb\">Bomb (Su)</h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, chemists are adept at creating explosive catalysts and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. A chemist can infuse a number of catalysts in this manner each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier (a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>). Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert—their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored.</p><p>A chemist treats his bombs as thrown ammunition for the purposes of drawing and determining how many attacks he can make per round. Thrown bombs have a range increment of 20 feet and use the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon\">Throw Splash Weapon</a> special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/point-blank-shot-combat\">Point-Blank Shot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>, but are otherwise unaffected by feats like <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/rapid-shot-combat/\">Rapid Shot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat/\">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>, or other such feats that would let the chemist throw more bombs per round.</p><p>On a direct hit, a chemist’s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the chemist’s Intelligence modifier. The damage of a chemist’s bomb increases by 1d6 points for every two chemist levels after 1st. Splash damage from a chemist bomb is always equal to the bomb’s minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + half of the chemist’s level + his Intelligence modifier.</p><p>Chemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up. A chemist’s bomb becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.</p><h3 id=\"alchemy\">Alchemy</h3><p>At 1st level, the chemist adds his chemist level as a competence bonus on all Craft (alchemy) checks and can use Craft (alchemy) to identify <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/\">alchemical items</a>.</p><h3 id=\"craft-alchemical-item\">Craft Alchemical Item (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, chemists receive <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/item-creation-feats/craft-alchemical-item/\">Craft Alchemical Item</a> as a bonus feat. The chemist does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. The chemist uses their own chemist levels for the purpose of qualifying for caster level requirements when crafting alchemical items.</p><p>Starting at 1st level, the chemist may also ignore 1st level spell requirements when crafting alchemical items. At 3rd level and every two chemist levels thereafter, the chemist ignores additional spell level requirements (2nd at 3rd chemist level, 3rd at 5th chemist level, etc.).</p><p>Additionally, the saving throw DCs of alchemical items made by the chemist are always 10 + spell level of item’s required spell + the chemist’s Intelligence modifier.</p><h3 id=\"throw-anything\">Throw Anything (Ex)</h3><p>All chemists gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/throw-anything-combat-final/\">Throw Anything</a> feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. A chemist adds his Intelligence modifier to damage done with Throw Splash Weapon, including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.</p><h3 id=\"alchemical-touch\"><strong>Alchemical Touch</strong> (Ex)</h3><p>At 2nd level, as a swift action, the chemist can infuse a held <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/\">alchemical item</a> to apply its effects on <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/#contact\">contact</a> that would normally only affect a creature if it were ingested or inhaled. This effect is bestowed on the item for 1 round, and only affects creatures other than the chemist himself.</p><h3 id=\"discoveries\">Discoveries (Su)</h3><p>At 2nd level, and then again every two chemist levels thereafter (up to 18th level), a chemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, a chemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the chemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + half of the chemist’s level + his Intelligence modifier.</p><ul><li>A complete list of discoveries can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/chemist/discoveries/\">Discoveries</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"swift-alchemy\">Swift Alchemy (Ex)</h3><p>At 3rd level, a chemist can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes a chemist half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items.</p><h3 id=\"throw-items\">Throw Items (Ex)</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, a chemist perfects his throwing technique. The chemist may take 10 on any ranged touch attacks with thrown alchemical items against willing targets. Additionally, if the chemist makes a ranged touch attack with a thrown alchemical item against an unwilling target, for every 10 the chemist surpasses against their touch AC, increase any associated DC by 1. This bonus to DC does not apply to helpless targets.</p><h3 id=\"alchemical-mixture\">Alchemical Mixture (Ex)</h3><p>At 4th level, a chemist can make temporary <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/\">alchemical items</a> as mixtures to use throughout the day. He can prepare a maximum number of mixtures equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier, or a lesser amount as noted below. Additionally, the combined worth of the alchemical items cannot exceed 750 gil per chemist level. </p><p>After resting, a chemist prepares his mixtures for that day. If he wants to prepare all his mixtures, the process takes 30 minutes. Preparing some smaller portion of his daily capacity takes a proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 5 minutes, the minimum time required to mix the proper chemicals state. If the chemist purposely leaves some of his daily capacity empty, he can repeat the preparation process as often as he likes to fill in more mixtures. He cannot, however, remove previous mixtures for new ones, he instead makes use of any leftover capacity from his daily allotment.</p><p>When the chemist wishes to use these items, he can complete an item during the action to retrieve them or a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a> if they are already in hand which must then be used within a number of rounds equal to his chemist level or lose all potency.</p><p>At 4th level, these items can only be <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/#tablepress-337-name\">Tier 1</a>. At 7th level, the chemist can create an alchemical item from the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/#tablepress-338-name\">Tier 2</a> list. At 10th level, the chemist can create an alchemical item from the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/#tablepress-339-name\">Tier 3</a> list. At 13th level, the chemist can create an alchemical item from the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/#tablepress-340-name\">Tier 4</a> list.</p><h3 id=\"alchemical-manipulation\"><strong>Alchemical Manipulation (Ex)</strong></h3><p>Starting at 5th level, a chemist learns new abilities to manipulate alchemical essence, allowing the creation of new alchemical items from existing ones.</p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><em>Desynthesis:</em> At 5th level, a chemist can desynthesize an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/\">alchemical item</a>, allowing him to extract (create) any number of equivalent tier or lower alchemical items from it so long as the total gil cost is equal to or lower than the alchemical item being desynthesized. This process takes 1 hour without interruption, and requires a Craft (alchemy) skill check for the tier they are desynthesizing from (DC 20 for <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/#tablepress-337-name\">Tier 1</a>, +5 for each additional tier) or no alchemical items are extracted. The desynthesized item is destroyed in the process, even if the chemist fails his Craft (alchemy) skill check.</li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><em>Synthesis:</em> At 9th level, a chemist can synthesize a new <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/\">alchemical item</a> from already existing ones, so long as the total gil cost of these items is equal to or higher than the alchemical item being synthesized. This process takes 1 hour without interruption, and requires a Craft (alchemy) skill check for the tier they are synthesizing to (DC 20 for <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magical-items/alchemical-items/#tablepress-337-name\">Tier 1</a>, +5 for each additional tier) or the items are ruined. Tier 4 and 5 alchemical items are not eligible for Synthesis. The alchemical items used for Synthesis are destroyed in the process, even if the chemist fails his Craft (alchemy) skill check.</li></ul><h3 id=\"deft-hands\">Deft Hands (Ex)</h3><p>Also at 5th level, a chemist becomes so accustomed to where his alchemical items lie, he may draw them from his person as a free action instead of a move action.</p><h3 id=\"alchemical-savant\">Alchemical Savant (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 6th level, the chemist has become accustomed to crafting alchemical items. The amount of alchemical items he is allowed to craft per day increases to 2, as opposed to the limit of 1 magic item per day limit, as long as he would have the time to do so. (A 6th level chemist could make two tier 1 items in 1 day as that only takes 2 hours. A 15th level chemist can only make two tier 4 items unless he can speed up the creation process.) This increases to 3/day at 9th level, 4/day at 12th level, and 5/day at 15th level.</p><h3 id=\"improved-quaff-potion\">Improved Quaff Potion (Ex)</h3><p>At 7th level, the chemist can ingest alchemical items quickly. He can ingest an alchemical item as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a> instead of a standard action. In addition, when the chemist ingests an alchemical item, he gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier.</p><h3 id=\"item-lore\">Item Lore (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">Starting at 8th level, the chemist’s knowledge of alchemy allows him to increase the potency of alchemical items of tier 1 quality. Any alchemical items created by the chemist that Inflicts damage or inflicts a negative status effect treat the effect as though it was a spell cast by the chemist himself, using his chemist level in place of a caster level and his Intelligence modifier as the casting modifier; for example, a 10th level chemist with an Intelligence score of 18 making an Earth Drum (which replicates the <em>stone II</em> spell) would make the item deal 3d6 + 4 (Int mod) + 10 (caster level) earth damage. At 12th level and every four chemist levels thereafter, the chemist applies this to the next tier of alchemical items.</p><h3 id=\"chain-reaction\">Chain Reaction (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 10th level, whenever the chemist would administer or hit a creature with an alchemical item that successfully applies or removes an effect or status effect, he can set off a chemical chain reaction to affect an additional nearby creature. Any healing or damage that is part of an alchemical item’s effect does not spread. The chemist may affect one additional creature at 10th level, gaining an additional creature to affect thereafter every fourth level after 10th, no two of which can be more than 20 feet apart. A chain reaction cannot occur off of another chain reaction.</p><h3 id=\"auto-potion\">Auto-Potion (Ex)</h3><p>At 11th level, the chemist can take an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#immediate\">immediate action</a> when hit, after the damage is calculated but before any status effects, by a melee attack or ranged attack to drink a potion. He must have a free hand to use this ability but does not provoke an attack of opportunity. He can only use this ability once a round.</p><h3 id=\"safeguard\"><strong>Safeguard (Ex)</strong></h3><p>At 11th level, the chemist is able to protect his gear and his belongings from the harms of battle with great speed and precision. He is immune to steal combat maneuvers and gains a +4 bonus to his CMD versus sunder and disarm combat maneuvers. A helpless chemist does not gain the benefits of this ability.</p><h3 id=\"quaff-potion-mastery\">Quaff Potion Mastery (Ex)</h3><p>At 13th level, the chemist’s ability to ingest alchemical items becomes legendary. He can ingest an alchemical item as a swift action instead of a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a>. The chemist also doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity from ingesting an alchemical item. In addition, when ingesting an alchemical item, the bonus to saving throws increases to +4.</p><h3 id=\"defensive-bombing\">Defensive Bombing (Ex)</h3><p>At 15th level, the chemist becomes adept at throwing bombs that he no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when throwing bombs.</p><h3 id=\"distracting-bombs\">Distracting Bombs (Ex)</h3><p>At 15th level, the chemist can reduce his bomb damage by one die to give it the ability to distract the creature it strikes. If a creature takes a direct hit from his bomb, it must succeed at a Reflex saving throw against the bomb’s DC or be unable to make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. This is in addition to any other effects the bomb would normally have.</p><h3 id=\"reliable-bombs\">Reliable Bombs (Ex)</h3><p>At 17th level, a chemist gains a +2 bonus to the DC values to resist the effects and damage of his bombs.</p><h3 id=\"instant-alchemy\">Instant Alchemy (Ex)</h3><p>At 19th level, a chemist can create alchemical items with almost supernatural speed. He can create any alchemical item as a full-round action if he succeeds at the Craft (alchemy) check and has the appropriate resources at hand to fund the creation.</p><h3 id=\"grand-discovery\">Grand Discovery (Su)</h3><p>At 20th level, the chemist makes a grand discovery. He immediately learns two normal discoveries, but also learns a third discovery chosen from the linked list below, representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import. For many chemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work.</p><ul><li><em>Awakened Intellect:</em> The chemist’s constant exposure to strange chemicals has expanded his mind. His Intelligence score permanently increases by 2 points.</li><li><em>Eternal Youth:</em> The chemist has discovered a cure for aging, and from this point forward he takes no penalty to his physical ability scores from advanced age. If the chemist is already taking such penalties, they are removed at this time.</li><li><em>Fast Healing:</em> The chemist’s flesh responds to damage with shocking speed—he gains fast healing 5.</li><li><em>Poison Touch:</em> The chemist gains a poisonous touch, as if under the effects of a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/poisoned-touch/\"><em>poisoned touch</em></a> spell. He can suppress or activate this ability as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>. The physical appearance of how the chemist generates and delivers his poisonous touch varies from chemist to chemist.</li></ul><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have chemist as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/al-bhed/\"><strong>Al Bhed</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Add +1/4 to the chemist’s damage rolls with thrown weapons.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/burmecian/\"><strong>Burmecian</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The chemist gains +1/6 of a new discovery.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/dwarf/\"><strong>Dwarf</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add +1 foot to the range increment of the chemist’s thrown splash weapons (including the chemist’s bombs).

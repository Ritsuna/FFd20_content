While some creators of alchemical items content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants, the true chemist answers a deeper calling. Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the chemist captures his own magic potential within liquids and extracts he creates, infusing his chemicals with virulent power to grant him impressive skill with explosives.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> The chemist&rsquo;s reputation is not softened by his exuberance (some would say dangerous recklessness) in perfecting his potion-<wbr />like creations, infusing these substances with magic siphoned from his aura and using his own body as experimental stock. Nor is it mollified by the chemist&rsquo;s almost gleeful passion for building explosive bombs. These traits, while making him a liability and risk for most civilized organizations and institutions of higher learning, seem to fit quite well with most adventuring groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth:</strong> 3d6 &times; 10 gil (average 105 gil.)

features of the chemist.</p>\n<h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Chemists are proficient with all simple weapons, simple firearms, and bombs. Chemists are proficient with light armor, but not with any type of shields.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the chemist receives the Limit Breaks (Mega-<wbr />Item and Perfect Bomb).</p>\n<p><em>Mega-<wbr />Item (Su):</em>&nbsp;This Limit Break transforms a single alchemical item into a very potent version. All variable, numeric effects are maximized. It lasts for the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four chemist levels after 1st before it loses all potency.&nbsp;This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<p><em>Perfect Bomb (Su):</em>&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the chemist to create the perfect bomb. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four chemist levels after 1st, the chemist creates one of these bombs which he can throw at double the normal range and deals maximum damage. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bomb\">Bomb (Su)</h3>\n<p>Beginning of 1st level, chemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-<wbr />Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, a chemist&rsquo;s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the chemist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>The damage of a chemist&rsquo;s bomb increases by 1d6 points for every three chemist levels after 1st (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from a chemist bomb is always equal to the bomb&rsquo;s minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + half of the chemist&rsquo;s level + his Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Chemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up. A chemist&rsquo;s bomb becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alchemy\">Alchemy</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the chemist adds his chemist level as a competence bonus on all Craft (alchemy) checks and can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"craft-alchemical-item\">Craft Alchemical Item (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, chemists receive <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/item-creation-feats/craft-alchemical-item/\">Craft Alchemical Item</a> as a bonus feat. The chemist does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. The chemist uses their own chemist levels for the purpose of qualifying for caster level requirements when crafting alchemical items. Starting at 1st level, the chemist may also ignore 1st level spell requirements when crafting alchemical items. At 3rd level and every two chemist levels thereafter, the chemist ignores the spell level requirements (2nd at 3rd chemist level, 3rd at 5th chemist level, etc.) Additionally, the saving throw DCs of alchemical items made by the chemist are always 10 + spell level of item&rsquo;s required spell + the chemist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"throw-anything\">Throw Anything (Ex)</h3>\n<p>All chemists gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/throw-anything-combat-final/\">Throw Anything</a> feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. A chemist adds his Intelligence modifier to damage done with Throw Splash Weapon, including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"throw-alchemical-item\">Throw Alchemical Item (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a chemist can Throw Alchemical Items to allies within 15 feet. This improves by an additional 15 feet for every four levels afterwards to a maximum of 60 feet. The chemist must hit an AC of 10 (+/-<wbr />&nbsp;from size). The recipient must have a hand free to catch the potion. If the recipient is adjacent to an enemy, he provokes an attack of opportunity. If the chemist has multiple attacks, he can throw up to that many alchemical items as a full-<wbr />attack action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"discovery\">Discoveries (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, and then again every two chemist levels thereafter (up to 18th level), a chemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, a chemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the chemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + half of the chemist&rsquo;s level + his Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of discoveries can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/chemist/discoveries/\">Discoveries</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"swift-alchemy\">Swift Alchemy (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, a chemist can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes a chemist half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alchemical-mixture\">Alchemical Mixture (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 4th level, a chemist can make a temporary alchemical item. As a full-round action, a chemist can create an alchemical item from the tier 1 list from the alchemical item list at no cost, using no materials and able to use it or throw it immediately. If not used or thrown immediately, an alchemical item created this way only lasts for 1 round per chemist level before it loses all potency. The chemist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. At 11th level, a chemist can create an alchemical item from the tier 2 list. At 18th level, a chemist can create an alchemical item from the tier 3 list.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anesthetic\">Anesthetic</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, a chemist learns how to supplement uses of the Heal skill with pain-<wbr />killing drugs. He gains <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/skill-focus-final/\">Skill Focus</a> (Heal) as a bonus feat. Any use of the Heal skill that has a risk of harming the patient (such as extracting a barb) only deals the minimum damage when performed by a chemist. If the chemist already has this feat, he may pick another Non-Combat feat for which he must meet the prerequisites for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alchemical-savant\">Alchemical Savant (Ex)</h3>\n<p class=\"western\">At 6th level, the chemist has become accustomed to crafting alchemical items. The amount of alchemical items he is allowed to craft per day increases to 2, as opposed to the limit of 1 magic item per day limit, as long as he would have the time to do so. (A 6th level chemist could make two tier 1 items in 1 day as that only takes 2 hours. A 15th level chemist can only make two tier 4 items unless he can speed up the creation process.) This increases to 3/day at 9th level, 4/day at 12th level, and 5/day at 15th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-quaff-potion\">Improved Quaff Potion (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 7th level, the chemist can ingest alchemical items quickly. He can ingest an alchemical item as a move action instead of a standard action. In addition, when the chemist ingests an alchemical item, he gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"item-lore\">Item Lore (Ex)</h3>\n<p class=\"western\">Starting at 8th level, the chemist&rsquo;s knowledge of alchemy allows him to increase the potency of alchemical items of tier 1 quality. Any alchemical items created by the chemist that replicate a spell effect treat the effect as though it was a spell cast by the chemist himself, using his chemist level in place of a caster level and his Intelligence modifier as the casting modifier; for example, a 10th level chemist with an Intelligence score of 18 making an Earth Drum (which replicates the <em>stone II</em> spell) would make the item deal 3d6 + 4 (Int mod) + 10 (caster level) earth damage. At 12th level and every four chemist levels thereafter, the chemist applies this to the next tier of alchemical items.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mix\">Mix (Ex)</h3>\n<p class=\"western\">At 9th level, as a full-round action, a chemist can mix two or more alchemical items together for a new alchemical item of a higher tier, to a maximum of tier 3. When creating a new alchemical item, the chemist must have two or more alchemical items of the same tier (tier 1 or 2) of a total cost equal to at least half of the item that he wishes to convert to, which then creates any alchemical item of a higher tier. The chemist must make a Craft (alchemy) skill check for the tier they are crafting into (DC 25 for tier 2, and DC 30 for tier 3) or the items are ruined. Temporary alchemical items cannot be used with this ability. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"auto-potion\">Auto-Potion (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, the chemist can take an immediate action when hit by a melee attack or ranged attack to drink a potion. He must have a free hand to use this ability but does not provoke an attack of opportunity. He can only use this ability once a round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quaff-potion-mastery\">Quaff Potion Mastery (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, the chemist&rsquo;s ability to ingest alchemical items becomes legendary. He can ingest an alchemical item as a swift action instead of a move action. The chemist also doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity from ingesting an alchemical item. In addition, when ingesting an alchemical item, the bonus to saving throws increases to +4.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defensive-bombing\">Defensive Bombing (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 15th level, the chemist becomes adept at throwing bombs that he no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when throwing bombs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alchemical-diffusion\">Alchemical Diffusion (Ex)</h3>\n<p class=\"western\">At 17th level, the chemist has items designed to explode their contents in an area rather than be drank. As a standard action, the chemist can designate an alchemical item in his inventory that normally affects only one target to instead have a radius of 20 feet. To avoid this, targets in the area must make a Reflex save (DC determined by the item) to take half damage and/or negate any status effects as normal. He can designate items ahead of time to receive this effect using the same action, but he can only hold a number of alchemically diffused items equal to his Intelligence modifier and once designated to receive the benefit of Alchemical Diffusion, it cannot be reversed. If he gives the alchemically diffused item to anyone else, it does not receive the benefits of alchemical diffusion when used. The chemist can alchemically diffuse a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h3 id=\"instant-alchemy\">Instant Alchemy (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, a chemist can create alchemical items with almost supernatural speed. He can create any alchemical item as a full-<wbr />round action if he succeeds at the Craft (alchemy) check and has the appropriate resources at hand to fund the creation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grand-discovery\">Grand Discovery (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, the chemist makes a grand discovery. He immediately learns two normal discoveries, but also learns a third discovery chosen from the linked list below, representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import. For many chemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Awakened Intellect:</em>&nbsp;The chemist&rsquo;s constant exposure to strange chemicals has expanded his mind. His Intelligence score permanently increases by 2 points.</li>\n<li><em>Eternal Youth:</em>&nbsp;The chemist has discovered a cure for aging, and from this point forward he takes no penalty to his physical ability scores from advanced age. If the chemist is already taking such penalties, they are removed at this time.</li>\n<li><em>Fast Healing:</em>&nbsp;The chemist&rsquo;s flesh responds to damage with shocking speed&mdash;he gains fast healing 5.</li>\n<li><em>Poison Touch:</em>&nbsp;The chemist gains a poisonous touch, as if under the effects of a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/poisoned-touch/\"><em>poisoned touch</em></a> spell. He can suppress or activate this ability as a free action. The physical appearance of how the chemist generates and delivers his poisonous touch varies from chemist to chemist.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have chemist as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/al-bhed/\"><strong>Al Bhed</strong></a><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Add +1/4 to the chemist&rsquo;s damage rolls with thrown weapons.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/burmecian/\">Burmecian</a>:</strong>&nbsp;The chemist gains +1/6 of a new discovery.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/dwarf/\">Dwarf</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Add +1 foot to the range increment of the chemist&rsquo;s thrown splash weapons (including the chemist&rsquo;s bombs).

Born amidst the timeless conflict between men and dragons, these lance-wielding knights have developed an aerial style of combat, that they might better pierce the scaled hides of their mortal foes. Taking to the firmament as though it were an extension of the land, they descend upon the enemy with every ounce of their bodies behind the blow. It is this penetrative power that characterizes the dragoon.</p>\n<p>Role:&nbsp;Dragoons tend to be on the front-<wbr />lines, jumping into the midst of battle.

features of the dragoon.</p>\n<h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>A dragoon is proficient with simple weapons, all spears, lances, and polearms. They are also proficient with all armor (light, medium, and heavy) but not with any shields.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the dragoon receives the Limit Breaks (Bahamut Leaps and Lancet).</p>\n<p>Bahamut Leaps (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the dragoon to jump further than ever before. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four dragoon levels after 1st, the dragoon can jump further than his speed allows, doubles the bonus to acrobatics granted to him by his jump class feature, reduces the DC multiplier for high jumps by 1 (minimum 1), and does not provoke when jumping. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<p>Lancet (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break causes any attacks the dragoon makes that successfully hits to heal him. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four dragoon levels after 1st, the dragoon heals for 1d6 points of damage + an additional 1d6 points of damage per four dragoon levels after 1st whenever the dragoon makes a successful attack. Each successful attack deals additional damage equal to the amount healed. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"strengthened-agility\">Strengthened Agility (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Beginning of 1st level, a dragoon may treat his Acrobatic skill, using his Strength modifier instead of Dexterity when making Jump checks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump\">Jump (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, a dragoon trains for years in the ability to leap astounding and nearly supernatural distances, emulating the dragon&rsquo;s ability to fly. The dragoon adds his dragoon levels to all Acrobatic skill checks for jumping. A dragoon&rsquo;s ability to jump with his Acrobatic checks is treated as though he got a running start and has the Run feat, regardless of whether or not he gets a running start. In addition, the dragoon may jump as part of a charge action allowing him to ignore difficult terrain for the distance he jumps. A dragoon&rsquo;s maximum jump distance is 2x his base speed, as if charging, instead of being limited by his normal base speed (30-foot land speed, 60-foot jump maximum).</p>\n<p>Beginning at 4th level, the DC multiplier for a high jump is reduced by 1, making it a multiplier of 3 rather than 4. This reduction improves by 1 every seven dragoon levels; multiplier of 2 at 11th level, and multiplier of 1 at 18th level. A dragoon using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity unless he passes through a square that is threatened by a flying creature that he is not attacking directly or jumping while adjacent to an enemy creature. If a dragoon is hit in this manner, he falls to the ground prone in the square in front of the creature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deadly-lancer\">Deadly Lancer (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the dragoon has learned the technique of falling from the sky upon his opponents to inflict more damage. As a move action before a melee attack with a spear, polearm, or lance or as part of a charge, the dragoon may make an Acrobatics check to jump with a DC equal to his target&rsquo;s CMD. The DC increases by +2 for each size category larger than the dragoon. If the dragoon beats the DC, depending on his Acrobatics roll, he moves forward to make the jump and gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for one round, a +1 circumstance bonus on that attack roll, and deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on that attack. In addition, for every five the dragoon beats the DC, he gains an additional +1 bonus to his AC and the attack roll, and deals an additional 1d6 damage. This bonus and the number of extra dice cannot exceed the dragoon&rsquo;s level. This additional damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. When using Deadly Lancer the dragoon cannot benefit from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/vital-strike-combat/\">Vital Strike</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shaft-trip\">Shaft Trip (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, a dragoon treats spears, lances, and polearms as trip weapons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acrobatic-talents\">Acrobatic Talents (Ex or Su)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a dragoon gains one acrobatic talent. He gains one additional acrobatic talent for every 2 dragoon levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a dragoon cannot select an individual acrobatic talent more than once.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of acrobatic talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/dragoon/acrobatic-talents/\">Acrobatic Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"pole-fighting\">Pole Fighting (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, as an immediate action, a dragoon can shorten the grip on his spear, lance, or polearm with reach and use it against adjacent targets. This action results in a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls with that weapon until he spends another immediate action to return to the normal grip. The penalty is reduced by &ndash;1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"balanced-stride\">Balanced Stride (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, the dragoon gains a +1 bonus on Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity. This bonus increases by 1 for every four dragoon levels he has beyond 2nd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"armor-training\">Armor Training (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, a dragoon learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum &ndash;5 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +5 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>\n<p>In addition, a dragoon can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a &nbsp;dragoon &nbsp;can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"steadfast-pike\">Steadfast Pike (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, a dragoon gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with readied attacks and attacks of opportunity made with a spear, lance, or polearm. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 3rd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hardy-landing\">Hardy Landing (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 4th level, the dragoon becomes skilled at diving through the air after a high jump and absorbing the impact of the long fall. When first using this ability, the dragoon takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The dragoon&rsquo;s ability to absorb his fall improves with his dragoon level until at 20th level he can fall any distance without harm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vault\">Vault (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Spears, lances, and polearms are more than just weapons to a dragoon. Beginning at 4th level, a dragoon gains a +10 bonus to Acrobatics skill checks when making a long jump while wielding a spear, lance, or polearm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dragoon-training\">Dragoon Training (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level a dragoon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with spears, lances, and polearms. This bonus increases by +1 for every five levels beyond 5th.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pike-charge\">Pike Charge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, a dragoon learns to make more accurate charge attacks with spears, lances, and polearms. He receives a +4 bonus on melee attacks when charging with a spear, lance, or polearm (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the dragoon takes no penalty to his AC after making a charge attack with a spear, lance, or polearm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fighter-training\">Fighter Training (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, a dragoon counts half his total dragoon level as his fighter level for the purpose of qualifying for feats. If he has levels in fighter, these levels stack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"spinning-lance\">Spinning Lance (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 7th level, a dragoon may alternate attacks with the piercing head of his lance or polearm with reach, or with the butt end (treat as a club) against adjacent targets. Unlike a double weapon, the masterwork quality and magical special abilities apply to both ends of the lance or polearm, except for those weapon special abilities that apply only to edged weapons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sweeping-fend\">Sweeping Fend (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 9th level, a dragoon receives a +4 bonus to his CMD when resisting bull rush or trip attempts while wielding a spear, lance, or polearm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tail-sweep\">Tail Sweep (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 9th level, a dragoon is able to use his weapon in the same way a dragon uses its tail. A dragoon may make a tail sweep action as a full-round action. To do so, he chooses 3 consecutive squares he threatens and rolls damage normally for the weapon (which must be a spear, polearm, or lance) in use. Each character, friend or foe, in the affected area, rolls a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the dragoon&rsquo;s level + his Strength modifier) or fall prone. This attack is effective against enemies the same size or smaller than the dragoon. If the attack strikes any enemy larger than the dragoon, the attack does damage as normal, but becomes immune to the knockdown effect. At 14th level, the dragoon affects all squares he threatens with tail sweep. The dragoon may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Strength modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"springing-charge\">Springing Charge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, when the dragoon jumps a distance of 10 or more feet using a charge action, he may move after the attack, but the dragoon&rsquo;s total distance that he can move cannot be greater than his speed. The dragoon does not provoke any attacks of opportunity from the target of his attack. A dragoon cannot use this ability to attack a foe that is adjacent to him at the start of his turn.</p>\n<h3 id=\"agile-charger\">Agile Charger (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, a dragoon takes no penalties caused by difficult terrain while charging. His movement is still hampered by obstacles, poor visibility, and other conditions. This ability doesn&rsquo;t allow him to move through impassible terrain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-acrobatic-talents\">Advanced Acrobatic Talents (Ex or Su)</h3>\n<p>At 12th level, and every two levels thereafter, a dragoon can choose one of the following advanced acrobatic talents in place of an acrobatic talent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of advanced acrobatic talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/dragoon/acrobatic-talents/#advanced-acrobatic-talents\">Advanced Acrobatic Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"spear-parry\">Spear Parry and Riposte (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against the dragoon, he can take a cumulative &ndash;4 penalty on all attacks (including further parry attempts) until the end of his next turn and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack. The dragoon makes an attack roll as if he were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the dragoon, the dragoon takes a &ndash;2 penalty on this roll. If his result is greater than the attacking creature&rsquo;s result, the creature&rsquo;s attack automatically misses. The dragoon must declare the use of this ability after the creature&rsquo;s attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made. Upon performing a successful parry, the dragoon can, as an immediate action, make an attack against the creature whose attack he parried, provided that creature is within his reach. At 15th, 17th, and 19th levels, the penalty decreases by 1.</p>\n<h3 id=\"piercing-lance\">Piercing Lance (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 15th level, as a standard action or as part of a charge, a dragoon attacking a mounted opponent can make two attacks, one against the mount and the other against the rider, using his highest base attack bonus. Furthermore, if the mount is hit and its rider attempts to negate the hit with the Mounted Combat feat, the dragoon&rsquo;s attack roll is considered 4 higher when calculating the DC of the Ride check to negate the hit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ranged-set\">Ranged Set vs. Charge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A dragoon don&rsquo;t need to reach a charging opponent to stop him dead in his tracks. Beginning at 17th level, when a dragoon sets vs. charge as a ready action, he can throw his spear, lance, or polearm as a ranged attack against any opponent that charges within 30 feet of him. He does not need to be the target of the charge. If he hits, he automatically deals double damage. If he has the quick draw feat, he can do ranged set vs. charge once per attack he can make in a round, but can only target each charging creature once.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mighty-charge\">Mighty Charge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level, a dragoon learns to make devastating charge attacks while jumping. Double the critical threat range of any spears, lances, or polearms wielded during a charge while jumping. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, the dragoon can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"spearhead-charge\">Spearhead Charge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 19th level, a dragoon deals double damage when he charges with a spear, lance, or polearm. This is not the same as a critical hit. Creatures immune to critical hits are still vulnerable to spearhead charge. If he successfully scores a critical hit on a charge, a dragoon deals quadruple the normal damage (with a spear, lance, or polearm).</p>\n<h3 id=\"pike-defense\">Pike Defense (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, when an opponent threatened by a dragoon makes a melee attack against an ally, he may take an immediate action to grant his ally a +2 shield bonus to AC and DR 5/&mdash; against that attack. He may use this ability to protect himself, but only if the attacking creature is not adjacent to him.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leaping-charge\">Leaping Charge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, the dragoon has fully mastered charging the enemy from the skies. When jumping a distance of 10 or more feet using a charge action, the dragoon deals double the normal amount of damage. In addition, if the dragoon confirms a critical hit on a charge attack, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Fortitude save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 20 + his Strength modifier.</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.

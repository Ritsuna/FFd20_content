The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire—the pounding beat of the gunner. Gunners are a bold and mysterious lot.

While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</em></p><p><strong>Role:</strong> Gunners are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunners push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies.

the gunner.</p><h3 id=\"weapon-and-armor-proficiency\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3><p>Gunners are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/equipment/firearms/#simple\">simple firearms</a> and one <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/equipment/firearms/#advanced\">advanced firearm</a> of their choice. They are also proficient with light armor, but not with any type of shields.</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the gunner receives the Limit Breaks (Evasive Maneuvers and Trigger Happy).</p><p><em>Evasive Maneuvers (Su):</em> This Limit Break allows the gunner dodge all incoming range attacks (including ranged touch). Any range attacks automatically miss unless a natural roll of 20 is rolled, and even then, the critical threat is unconfirmed unless another natural roll of 20 is rolled. Any spells that require a Reflex saving throw are automatically made. This ability only dodges a number of attacks and spells equal to the gunner’s Dexterity modifier per round. This lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four gunner levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><p><em>Trigger Happy (Su): </em>This Limit Break allows the gunner to gain a number of attacks of opportunity equal to his Dexterity modifier; these attacks of opportunity can only be used with an equipped firearm. Additionally, the gunner threatens all enemies within his first range increment of his equipped firearm. This limit break lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four gunner levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><h3 id=\"gunsmith\">Gunsmith</h3><p>At 1st level, a gunner gains one of the following firearms of his choice: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/equipment/firearms/\">trainee pistol, trainee rifle or trainee shotgun</a>. His starting weapon is battered, and only he knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat his gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it’s worth 4d10 gil when sold). The gunner also gains <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/general-feats/gunsmithing/\">Gunsmithing</a> as a bonus feat.</p><p>At 5th level and every four gunner levels thereafter, a gunner can reconfigure his firearm with a single modification by spending 1 hour of work. Most modifications can only be taken once, unless specified. He may reconfigure his firearm as many times as he likes but is only granted up to 4 (at 17th level) of the following benefits at a time. The gunner can only modify 1 gun at a time, to a maximum allowed by this feature per gun (at 17th level, he can put 4 mods onto any number of guns). He can deconstruct modifications from his current gun by spending 1 hour of work but lose the modification and any gil spent towards it. These modifications only work for the gunner:<em> </em></p><ul><li><em>Adamantine Barrel:</em> Using adamantine allows for more powerful powder loads without the danger of warping or damaging the barrel.

The benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p><h3 id=\"skirmish\">Skirmish (Ex)</h3><p>A gunner relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her defense. At 1st level, she deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all ranged attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet away from where she was at the start of her turn, but only if the target is within 30 feet. The extra damage applies only to attacks made after the gunner has moved at least 10 feet. The skirmish ability cannot be used while mounted. The extra damage applies only to attacks taken during the gunner’s turn. This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every three gunner levels gained above 1st (2d6 at 4th, 3d6 at 7th, 4d6 at 10th, 5d6 at 13th, 6d6 at 16th, and 7d6 at 19th level). The gunner must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.</p><p>At 3rd level, a gunner gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the gunner has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves by 1 for every four gunner levels gained above 3rd (+2 at 7th, +3 at 11th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 19th level).</p><p>A gunner loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If she gains the sneak attack ability from another class, the bonuses stack. This damage is precision damage, so it doesn’t multiply on a critical hit.</p><h3 id=\"fast-movement\"><strong>Fast Movement (Ex)</strong></h3><p>Also at 1st level, when not firing or reloading, the gunner can quickly change position. When wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load, her base move speed increases by 10 feet. This bonus increases by 10 feet for every four gunner levels after 1st level.</p><h3 id=\"precision-aiming\">Precision Aiming (Ex)</h3><p>At 2nd level, a gunner gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every three gunner levels beyond 2nd.</p><h3 id=\"gun-fix\">Gun Fix (Ex)</h3><p>At 2nd level, as a swift action, the gunner can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p><h3 id=\"nimble\">Nimble (Ex)</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, a gunner gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunner to lose his Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunner to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level).</p><h3 id=\"gunnery-talents\">Gunnery Talents (Ex)</h3><p>As a gunner gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid his marksmanship skills. Starting at 2nd level, a gunner gains one gunnery talent. He gains an additional gunnery talent for every two levels of gunner attained after 2nd level. A gunner must meet the prerequisite of the talent selected and unless specified otherwise, each talent can only be selected once.</p><ul><li>A complete list of gunnery talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/gunner/gunnery-talents/\">Gunnery Talents</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"sharp-shooting\">Sharp-Shooting (Ex)</h3><p>At 3rd level, a gunner gains the ability to score hits that others would miss due to the target’s cover. If the gunner attacks the target using cover, the cover bonus to the target’s AC is reduced by 2.</p><h3 id=\"cover-fire\">Cover Fire (Ex)</h3><p>Beginning at 3rd level, the gunner knows not only how to directly engage his enemies, but also how to protect his allies. As an attack action, he may choose to fire a ranged weapon at an opponent within 30 feet to distract that opponent rather than to deal damage. The gunner makes an attack roll against the space a target occupies (AC 10). If successful, the targeted enemy must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the gunner’s level + his Dexterity modifier), or be staggered for one round. The gunner still expends ammunition as normal for this attack. If the attack roll would indicate a critical threat and the result would hit the opponent’s AC, roll to confirm: if the critical hit is confirmed against the opponent’s AC, the attack does normal damage as well. A gunner cannot use cover fire if his opponent or the square he targets would be subject to a miss chance (such as from a concealed target).</p><h3 id=\"gun-training\">Gun Training (Ex)</h3><p>Starting at 4th level, a gunner can select one specific type of firearm (such as any kind of pistol and any kind of rifle). He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when making ranged attacks with that type of firearm. In addition, he uses his Dexterity modifier as a bonus to ranged damage rolls (this bonus is halved if she has a level in another non-prestige class and this is not her favored class) with that type of firearm as well. Furthermore, when he misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th), the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases by +1.</p><h3 id=\"flanking-fire\">Flanking Fire (Ex)</h3><p>Beginning of 4th level, gunners are able to maneuver to their foes’ sides and backs, and take advantage of the way this exposes these foes to attack. A gunner’s ranged attacks up to his range increment count as melee attacks for the purposes of determining and awarding flanking bonuses. Both the gunner and the ally he is flanking with gain the flanking bonus.</p><h3 id=\"evasion\">Evasion (Ex)</h3><p>At 5th level and higher, a gunner can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the gunner is wearing light armor. A helpless gunner does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p><h3 id=\"improved-gunner-style\">Improved Gunner Style (Ex)</h3><p>At 5th level, a gunner’s aptitude with his guns improves. He is treated as having one of the following feats or a feat from the previous ability: <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-precise-shot-combat-final/\">Improved Precise Shot</a>, <a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/parting-shot-combat\">Parting Shot</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/ranged-disarm-combat-targeting/\">Ranged Disarm</a>, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p><h3 id=\"uncanny-dodge\">Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, a gunner can react to danger before his senses would normally allow his to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A gunner with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against his. If a gunner already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p><h3 id=\"hairtrigger\">Hairtrigger (Ex)</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, a gunner holding a drawn and loaded firearm at the ready receives a +4 circumstance bonus to Initiative.</p><h3 id=\"disengage\">Disengage (Ex)</h3><p>Once a gunner has reached 7th level, he learns how to effectively distance himself from enemies. When the gunner would provoke an attack of opportunity for moving out of a threatened space, he adds his Wisdom modifier to his Acrobatics rolls to avoid attacks of opportunity for the round and can move at full speed without increasing the Acrobatics DC.</p><h3 id=\"close-combat-shot\">Close Combat Shot (Ex)</h3><p>At 9th level, a gunner does not provoke attacks of opportunity when making ranged attacks with firearms within melee range of opponents.</p><h3 id=\"gunner-style-mastery\">Gunner Style Mastery (Ex)</h3><p>At 10th level, a gunner’s aptitude with his guns improves again. He is treated as having one of the following feats or a feat from the previous two abilities: <a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/pinpoint-targeting-combat-final\">Pinpoint Targeting</a> and <a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/shot-on-the-run-combat-final\">Shot on the Run</a>, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p><h3 id=\"improved-uncanny-dodge\">Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3><p>A gunner of 11th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense denies an enemy the ability to gain a bonus on attack rolls by flanking his, unless the attacker has at least four more character levels than the gunner does.</p><h3 id=\"covering-fire\">Covering Fire (Ex)</h3><p>Starting from 12th level, a gunner can expend a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a> to do nothing. Upon doing so, and until their next turn, he threatens attacks of opportunity with his firearm out to his first range increment.</p><h3 id=\"evasive-gunner\">Evasive Gunner (Ex)</h3><p>At 13th level, a gunner gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against ranged attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 17th level.</p><h3 id=\"critical-aim\">Critical Aim (Ex)</h3><p>At 14th level, the gunner’s aim becomes a precise deadliness. The critical threat range of all firearms in the hands of the gunner are increased by 1. At 18th level, this increases by 1 again. This stacks with Improved Critical and similar abilities, but is calculated after all other modifiers.</p><h3 id=\"improved-evasion\">Improved Evasion (Ex)</h3><p>At 15th level, the gunner’s evasion ability improves. This works like evasion, except that while the gunner still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless gunner does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p><h3 id=\"menacing-shot\"><strong>Menacing Shot (Ex)</strong></h3><p>At 15th level, the gunner can shoot a firearm into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst as if they were subject to the fear spell. The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + half of the gunner’s level + her Wisdom modifier.</p><h3 id=\"penetrating-shot\">Penetrating Shot (Ex)</h3><p>At 17th level, when a gunner confirms a critical hit with a firearm, the bullet pierces the target and can strike another creature in line behind it. The gunner must be able to trace a line starting at his space and passing through both targets to make this additional attack. The secondary attack is made at a –4 penalty, in addition to any modifiers for added range. If this attack is also a critical hit, the bullet can continue to hit another target, but the penalties stack.</p><h3 id=\"death-shot\">Death Shot (Ex)</h3><p>At 18th level, once per day, a gunner can make an attack with his firearm that is a guaranteed critical and has the chance of killing or incapacitating a target. After three rounds studying the target to line up a good shot, the gunner may decide whether to kill or incapacitate the target before the shot is fired, and the target is entitled to a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the gunner’s level + his Dexterity modifier). If the target fails his save, the target either dies or is incapacitated (brought to -1 hit points, but stabilized).</p><h3 id=\"ranged-specialist\">Ranged Specialist (Su)</h3><p>At 19th level, a gunner’s ranged attacks has his penalties for range increments halved. If the gunner has the Far Shot feat, he instead suffers no penalties for range increments.</p><h3 id=\"lethal-patience\"><strong>Lethal Patience (Ex)</strong></h3><p>While wild flurries of bullets are certainly effective at felling foes, veteran gunners appreciate the value of lining up the perfect shot. At 19th level, the gunner can line up a shot against a target as a full-round action. On her next turn, she can make an attack against the target as a standard action, and if the attack hits, the attack is treated as a critical threat.</p><h3 id=\"personal-armory\">Personal Armory (Ex)</h3><p>At 20th level, there is not a gun in the world that the gunner can’t fire. The gunner applies her gun training to all firearms, and her damage bonus from gun training increases to 1-1/2 times her Dexterity bonus.</p><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.

A gunner cannot use cover fire if his opponent or the square he targets would be subject to a miss chance (such as from a concealed target).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[["Support"]],"actions":[{"_id":"PLKBCeJk0eja5gUz","name":"Use","img":"systems/ffd20/icons/FFxiv-icons/FFXIVIcons-Battle-PvE/12_MCH/spread_shot.png","description":"","tag":"","activation":{"cost":1,"type":"nonaction"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":"1","units":"round"},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"personal","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":"none"},"uses":{"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","self":{"value":0,"maxFormula":"","per":null},"per":"unlimited","value":0,"maxFormula":"","max":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"naturalAttack":{"primaryAttack":true,"secondary":{"attackBonus":"-5","damageMult":0.5}},"nonlethal":false,"usesAmmo":false,"spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","conditionals":[],"enh":{"value":null}}],"uses":{"per":"unlimited","value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","max":0},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"featType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":[["Gunner"]]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"dri":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"kte":false,"lin":false,"nav":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pil":false,"pro":false,"rep":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"nonaction"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"nonaction"}},"duration":{"value":"1","units":"round"},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"personal","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":"none"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"soundEffect":"","nonlethal":false,"spellArea":"","conditionals":[],"identifiedName":"Cover Fire","size":"med"},"ownership":{"default":0,"ycrlGhzvaJX6CCh3":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"ffd20","systemVersion":"10.1.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1667423420099,"modifiedTime":1673662907707,"lastModifiedBy":"VNk1dF8h7rdEhEd4"},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_qql5waih0h"}}}

The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&mdash;the pounding beat of the gunner. Gunners are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a mage typically reserves for his spells, most gunners know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>\n<p>Role:&nbsp;Gunners are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunners push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunners are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>\n<p>Alignment:&nbsp;Any</p>\n<p>Hit Die:&nbsp;d8</p>\n<p>Starting Wealth:&nbsp;5d6 x 10 gil (average 175 gil).

are class features of the gunner.</p>\n<h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Gunners are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are also proficient with light armor, but not with any type of shields.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the gunner receives the Limit Breaks (Evasive Maneuvers and Trigger Happy).</p>\n<p>Evasive Maneuvers (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the gunner dodge all incoming range attacks (including ranged touch). Any range attacks automatically miss unless a natural roll of 20 is rolled, and even then, the critical threat is unconfirmed unless another natural roll of 20 is rolled. Any spells that require a Reflex saving throw are automatically made. This lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four gunner levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<p>Trigger Happy (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the gunner to gain a number of attacks of opportunity equal to his Dexterity modifier; these attacks of opportunity can only be used with an equipped firearm. Additionally, the gunner threatens all enemies within his first range increment of his equipped firearm. This limit break lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four gunner levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gunsmith\">Gunsmith</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, a gunner gains one of the following firearms of his choice:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/equipment/firearms/\">trainee pistol, trainee rifle or trainee shotgun</a>. his starting weapon is battered, and only he knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat his gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it&rsquo;s worth 4d10 gil when sold). The gunner also gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/general-feats/gunsmithing/\">Gunsmithing</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every four gunner levels thereafter, a gunner can reconfigure his firearm with a single modification by spending 1 hour of work. Most modifications can only be taken once, unless specified. He may reconfigure his firearm as many times as he likes but is only granted up to 4 (at 17th level) of the following benefits at a time. The gunner can only modify 1 gun at a time, to a maximum allowed by this feature per gun (level 17 can put 4 mods onto any number of guns) they can deconstruct modifications from their current gun by spending 1 hour of work but lose the modification and any gil spent towards it. These modifications only work for the gunner:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adamantine Barrel:&nbsp;Using adamantine allows for more powerful powder loads without the danger of warping or damaging the barrel. This firearm gains +2 bonus on firearm damage rolls. This does not increase the hardness of the weapon. This cannot be used with Heavy Barrel, Elongated Barrel, Exotic Metal Barrel, or Molybdenum Barrel.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;4,500 gil.&nbsp;Prerequisite:&nbsp;The gunner must be at least 9th level to select this modification.</li>\n<li>Clearing Mechanism:&nbsp;This modification allows the gunner to remove the broken condition from this firearm as a full-round action, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;1,500 gil.</li>\n<li>Cannon Bore:&nbsp;Shot from this firearm gain a +6 bonus on firearm damage but attacks after the first take a -3 penalty on attack rolls.

This modification grants +1 on attack rolls to hit a target within 20&rsquo;.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;1,500 gil.</li>\n<li>Comfort Grip:&nbsp;Attacks with this firearm are resolved against touch AC at the first and second range increments. This cannot be used with Potato Grip.&nbsp;Prerequisite:&nbsp;The gunner must be at least 9th level to select this modification.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;4,500 gil.</li>\n<li>Compensator:&nbsp;Attached to the end of the barrel, a compensator reduces recoil by directing waste energy upwards forcing the barrel down. This provides a +1 bonus to hit on attacks made after first attack the gunner makes in a round.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;1,500 gil.</li>\n<li>Dual-Balanced:&nbsp;When wielding two weapons with the dual-balanced modification, reduce any two-weapon fighting penalties by 1 for both weapons.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;2,000 gil.</li>\n<li>Elongated Barrel:&nbsp;The elongated barrel allows for surer aim and grants +1 bonus to firearm attack rolls.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;1,500 gil.</li>\n<li>Exotic Metal Barrel:&nbsp;Using exotic metals collected over a career of adventuring, the gunner creates a barrel out of a previously unknown alloy. This barrel makes shots fired deal damage as if they were one size category larger and add an additional +4 bonus on firearm damage rolls. This cannot be used with Adamantine Barrel, Elongated Barrel, Heavy Barrel, or Molybdenum Barrel.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;7,000 gil.&nbsp;Prerequisite:&nbsp;The gunner must be at least 13th level to select this modification.</li>\n<li>Greater Ammo Capacity:&nbsp;The reconfigured weapon can hold 50% more ammunition than normal.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;1,500 gil.</li>\n<li>Heavy Barrel:&nbsp;The heavy barrel allows a stronger powder charge without danger of warping.

This modification can be selected more than once.&nbsp;Cost:&nbsp;2,000 gil.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"gunner-style\">Gunner Style (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the gunner is treated as having one of the following feats:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/deadly-aim-combat\">Deadly Aim</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/far-shot-combat-final\">Far Shot</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/point-blank-shot-combat-final\">Point Blank Shot</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat-final/\">Precise Shot</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/quick-draw-combat-final/\">Quick Draw</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/rapid-reload-combat-final\">Rapid Reload</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/rapid-shot-combat-final\">Rapid Shot</a>, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grit\">Grit (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A gunner makes his mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunners claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it&rsquo;s more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunners have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunner&rsquo;s ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunner gains a number of grit points equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). his grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunner spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>\n<p>Critical Hit with a Firearm:&nbsp;Each time the gunner confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, he regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunner&rsquo;s character level does not restore grit.</p>\n<p>Killing Blow with a Firearm:&nbsp;When the gunner reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, he regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunner&rsquo;s character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>\n<p>Grit and Panache:&nbsp;Grit and panache represent two different means by which heroes can gain access to the same heroic pool, using it to accomplish fantastic feats. For characters with a mix of grit and panache, they pool the resources together into a combined pool. For feats, magic items, and other effects, a grit user can spend and gain panache points in place of grit points, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deeds\">Deeds</h3>\n<p>Gunners spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunner some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-<wbr />lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunner has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunner deeds. A gunner can only perform deeds of his level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>\n<p>Deadeye (Ex):&nbsp;At 1st level, the gunner can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond his firearm&rsquo;s first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunner still takes the &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls for each range increment beyond the first when he performs this deed.</p>\n<p>Gunner&rsquo;s Dodge (Ex):&nbsp;At 1st level, the gunner gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunner, he can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so grants the gunner a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-<wbr />foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunner can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunner can only perform this deed while wearing light or no armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.</p>\n<p>Quick Clear (Ex):&nbsp;At 1st level, as a standard action, the gunner can remove the broken condition from a single firearm he is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunner must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunner spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, he can perform quick clear as a move-<wbr />equivalent action instead of a standard action.</p>\n<p>Steady Aim (Ex):&nbsp;At 1st level, as long as a gunner has at least 1 grit point, he can take a move-<wbr />equivalent action to increase the accuracy of his firearm. When he does, he increases the range increment of the weapon by 10 feet. This stacks with other abilities that increase his range increment.</p>\n<p>Sure Shot (Ex):&nbsp;At 1st level, when the gunner hits a target that is not making a scatter shot, he can spend 1 grit point to deal 1d6 points of extra damage on a hit. If he misses with the attack, he grazes the target, dealing half the extra damage anyway. He must choose to spend the grit point before he makes the attack roll. This is precision damage and is not multiplied if the attack is a critical hit. This precision damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, to 3d6 at 10th level, to 4d6 at 15th level, and to 5d6 at 20th level. This precision damage stacks with sneak attack and other forms of precision damage.</p>\n<p>Gunner Initiative (Ex):&nbsp;At 3rd level, as long as the gunner has at least 1 grit point, he gains the following benefits. First, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he has the Quick Draw feat, his hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, he can draw a single firearm as part of the initiative check.</p>\n<p>Pistol-<wbr />Whip (Ex):&nbsp;At 3rd level, the gunner can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of his firearm as a standard action. When he does, he is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-<wbr />whip ability is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-<wbr />handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-<wbr />handed firearms deal 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunner&rsquo;s size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/&times;2. If the attack hits, the gunner can make a trip combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.</p>\n<p>Utility Shot (Ex):&nbsp;At 3rd level, if the gunner has at least 1 grit point, he can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunner must declare the utility shot he is using before firing the shot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blast Lock:&nbsp;The gunner makes an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of his firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or Disable Device or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that spell.</li>\n<li>Scoot Unattended Object:&nbsp;The gunner makes an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of his firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunner does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot&rsquo;s origin. On a miss, he damages the object normally.</li>\n<li>Stop Bleeding:&nbsp;The gunner makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. The gunner does not have to make an attack roll when performing the deed in this way; he can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dead Shot (Ex):&nbsp;At 7th level, as a full-<wbr />round action, the gunner can take careful aim and pool all of his attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When he does this, he shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as he can, based on his gunner level for base attack bonus. He makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if he were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the gunner&rsquo;s single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the gunner increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-<wbr />level gunner firing a musket hits with both attacks, he does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, he confirms the critical once using his highest base attack bonus &ndash;5. For each critical threat beyond the first, he reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunner only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. He cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunner must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.</p>\n<p>Startling Shot (Ex):&nbsp;At 7th level, a gunner with least 1 grit point can spend a standard action to purposely miss a creature that he could normally hit with a firearm attack. When he does, that creature becomes flat-<wbr />footed until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p>Targeting (Ex):&nbsp;At 7th level, as a full-<wbr />round action, the gunner can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. He gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature he targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arms:&nbsp;On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunner&rsquo;s choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.</li>\n<li>Head:&nbsp;On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-<wbr />affecting effect.</li>\n<li>Legs:&nbsp;On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.</li>\n<li>Torso:&nbsp;Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19&ndash;20.</li>\n<li>Wings:&nbsp;On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20 Fly check or fall 20 ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bleeding Wound (Ex):&nbsp;At 11th level, when the gunner hits a living creature with a firearm attack, he can spend 1 grit point as a free action to have that attack deal extra bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the gunner&rsquo;s Dexterity modifier. Alternatively, the gunner can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage (gunner&rsquo;s choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.</p>\n<p>Clipping Shot (Ex):&nbsp;At 11th level, when the gunner misses with a firearm attack, he can spend 1 grit point to deal half the damage that attack would have dealt if it were a hit (roll damage normally). He can decide to use this deed and spend the grit point after making the attack. This deed has no effect if the attack used the dead shot deed. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-deed-grit/\">Signature Deed</a>&nbsp;feat or any similar effect.</p>\n<p>Gunner&rsquo;s Luck (Ex):&nbsp;At 15th level, the gunner can spend grit to reroll a saving throw or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1 grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunner must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. The deed&rsquo;s cost cannot be reduced by the true grit class ability, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-deed-grit/\">Signature Deed</a>&nbsp;feat, or any other effect that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.</p>\n<p>Menacing Shot (Ex):&nbsp;At 15th level, the gunner can spend 1 grit point, shoot a firearm into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-<wbr />foot-<wbr />radius burst as if they were subject to the fear spell. The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + half of the gunner&rsquo;s level + the gunner&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>Cheat Death (Ex):&nbsp;At 19th level, whenever the gunner is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, he can spend all of his remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.</p>\n<p>Dazing Shot (Ex):&nbsp;At 19th level, the gunner&rsquo;s shots can put spellcasters in a temporary stupor. As a full-round action, the gunner can spend a point of grit to take aim and fire a single non-scatter firearm at an enemy. If the attack hits, the enemy takes damage as normal, and must make a Fortitude save or else have his spells take longer to cast for a round. The affected enemy&rsquo;s spell&rsquo;s casting time increases by one step for the duration of this effect. Swift action spells become move actions, move actions become standard actions, and standard actions become 1 round casting times. Spells with higher casting times are not affected. This also applies to spell-like abilities. The DC to avoid this is 10 + half of the gunner&rsquo;s level + his Wisdom modifier. If the gunner spends 1 extra point of grit, he adds twice his Wisdom modifier to the DC. For every 5 points that the enemy fails their save, increase the duration of the effect by one round. The affected enemy can spend a full-round action to shake the effect off, thereby ending it early.</p>\n<p>Stunning Shot (Ex):&nbsp;At 19th level, when a gunner hits a creature, he can spend 2 grit points to stun the creature for 1 round. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half of the gunner&rsquo;s level + his Wisdom modifier). If the creature fails, it is stunned for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"precision-aiming\">Precision Aiming (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, a gunner gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every three gunner levels beyond 2nd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nimble\">Nimble (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a gunner gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunner to lose his Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunner to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level).</p>\n<h3 id=\"gunnery-talents\">Gunnery Talents (Ex)</h3>\n<p>As a gunner gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid his marksmanship&nbsp;skills. Starting at 2nd level, a&nbsp;gunner&nbsp;gains one&nbsp;gunnery&nbsp;talent. He gains an additional&nbsp;gunnery&nbsp;talent for every two levels of&nbsp;gunner&nbsp;attained after 2nd level. A&nbsp;gunner&nbsp;must meet the prerequisite of the talent selected and unless specified otherwise, each talent can only be selected once.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of gunnery talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/gunner/gunnery-talents/\">Gunnery Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"sharp-shooting\">Sharp-<wbr />Shooting (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, a gunner gains the ability to score hits that others would miss due to the target&rsquo;s cover. If the gunner attacks the target using cover, the cover bonus to the target&rsquo;s AC is reduced by 2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cover-fire\">Cover Fire (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 3rd level, the gunner knows not only how to directly engage his enemies, but also how to protect his allies. As an attack action, he may choose to fire a ranged weapon at an opponent within 30 feet to distract that opponent rather than to deal damage. The gunner makes an attack roll against the space a target occupies (AC 10). If successful, the targeted enemy must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the gunner&rsquo;s level + his Dexterity modifier), or be staggered for one round. The gunner still expends ammunition as normal for this attack. If the attack roll would indicate a critical threat and the result would hit the opponent&rsquo;s AC, roll to confirm: if the critical hit is confirmed against the opponent&rsquo;s AC, the attack does normal damage as well. A gunner cannot use cover fire if his opponent or the square he targets would be subject to a miss chance (such as from a concealed target).</p>\n<h3 id=\"gun-training\">Gun Training (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a gunner can select one specific type of firearm (such as standard pistol and standard rifle). He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. In addition, he uses his Dexterity modifier as a bonus to damage rolls with that type of firearm as well. Furthermore, when he misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th), the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases by +1.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flanking-fire\">Flanking Fire (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Beginning of 4th level, gunners are able to maneuver to their foes&rsquo; sides and backs, and take advantage of the way this exposes these foes to attack. A gunner&rsquo;s ranged attacks count as melee attacks for the purposes of determining and awarding flanking bonuses. Both the gunner and the ally he is flanking with gain the flanking bonus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evasion\">Evasion (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level and higher, a gunner can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the gunner is wearing light armor. A helpless gunner does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-gunner-style\">Improved Gunner Style (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, a gunner&rsquo;s aptitude with his guns improves. He is treated as having one of the following feats or a feat from the previous ability:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/grit-feats/\">Grit feat</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-precise-shot-combat-final/\">Improved Precise Shot</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/parting-shot-combat\">Parting Shot</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/point-blank-master-combat\">Point Blank Master</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/ranged-disarm-combat-targeting/\">Ranged Disarm</a>, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uncanny-dodge\">Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, a gunner can react to danger before his senses would normally allow his to do so. He cannot be caught flat-<wbr />footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A gunner with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against his. If a gunner already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hairtrigger\">Hairtrigger (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, a gunner holding a drawn and loaded firearm at the ready receives a +4 circumstance bonus to Initiative.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disengage\">Disengage (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Once a gunner has reached 7th level, he learns how to effectively distance herself from enemies. When the gunner would provoke an attack of opportunity for moving out of a threatened space, he adds his Wisdom modifier to his Acrobatics rolls to avoid attacks of opportunity for the round and can move at full speed without increasing the Acrobatics DC.</p>\n<h3 id=\"close-combat-shot\">Close Combat Shot (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 9th level, a gunner does not provoke attacks of opportunity when making ranged attacks with firearms within melee range of opponents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"belly-shot\">Belly Shot (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 9th level, the gunner can move herself in such a way that leaves the opponent wide open for a shot to the gut, though is dependent on the enemy&rsquo;s movement. As a swift action, the gunner can make a dirty trick combat maneuver against the opponent&rsquo;s CMD that doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity. This check can only be done once per turn and must me made before any attacks. If successful, until the start of the gunner&rsquo;s next turn, any ranged firearm attacks from the gunner that hit the target while adjacent deals +1d6 points of damage. This damage increases to +2d6 at 13th level and to +3d6 at 17th level. Creatures immune to precision damage, critical hits, or sneak attacks do not take this additional damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gunner-style-mastery\">Gunner Style Mastery (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 10th level, a gunner&rsquo;s aptitude with his guns improves again. He is treated as having one of the following feats or a feat from the previous two abilities:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/pinpoint-targeting-combat-final\">Pinpoint Targeting</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/shot-on-the-run-combat-final\">Shot on the Run</a>, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-uncanny-dodge\">Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A gunner of 11th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense denies an enemy the ability to gain a bonus on attack rolls by flanking his, unless the attacker has at least four more character levels than the gunner does.</p>\n<h3 id=\"covering-fire\">Covering Fire (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting from 12th level, a gunner can expend a move action to do nothing. Upon doing so, and until their next turn, he threatens attacks of opportunity with his firearm out to his first range increment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evasive-gunner\">Evasive Gunner (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, a gunner gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against ranged attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"critical-aim\">Critical Aim (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, the gunner&rsquo;s aim becomes a precise deadliness. The critical threat range of all firearms in the hands of the gunner are increased by 1. At 18th level, this increases by 1 again. This stacks with Improved Critical and similar abilities, but is calculated after all other modifiers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-evasion\">Improved Evasion (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 15th level, the gunner&rsquo;s evasion ability improves. This works like evasion, except that while the gunner still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless gunner does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"penetrating-shot\">Penetrating Shot (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level, when a gunner confirms a critical hit with a firearm, the bullet pierces the target and can strike another creature in line behind it. The gunner must be able to trace a line starting at his space and passing through both targets to make this additional attack. The secondary attack is made at a &ndash;4 penalty, in addition to any modifiers for added range. If this attack is also a critical hit, the bullet can continue to hit another target, but the penalties stack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"death-shot\">Death Shot (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 18th level, once per day, a gunner can make an attack with his firearm that is a guaranteed critical and has the chance of killing or incapacitating a target. After three rounds studying the target to line up a good shot, the gunner may decide whether to kill or incapacitate the target before the shot is fired, and the target is entitled to a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the gunner&rsquo;s level + his Dexterity modifier). If the target fails his save, the target either dies or is incapacitated (brought to -1 hit points, but stabilized).</p>\n<h3 id=\"ranged-specialist\">Ranged Specialist (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, a gunner&rsquo;s ranged attacks has his penalties for range increments halved. If the gunner has the Far Shot feat, he instead suffers no penalties for range increments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"true-grit\">True Grit (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, a gunner picks two deeds that he has access to and that he must spend grit to perform. He can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunner can perform this deed as long as he has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as he had at least 1 grit point, he can now perform that deed even when he has no grit points.</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have gunner as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/al-bhed/\">Al Bhed</a>:&nbsp;Add +1/4 point to the gunner&rsquo;s grit points.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/burmecian/\">Burmecian</a>:&nbsp;Add a +1/2 bonus on initiative checks when the gunner has at least 1 grit point.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/dwarf/\">Dwarf</a>:&nbsp;Reduce the misfire chance for one type of firearm by 1/4.

These gadgets have a multipurpose design to defend, protect, and support the gadgeteer and her allies. Starting at 1st level, the gadgeteer chooses two gadgets from the list below and begins play with them. At 5th and every five levels thereafter, the gadgeteer upgrades her gadgets she currently possess in order to represent her growing skill and power. If a gadget is destroyed, the gadgeteer must rebuild from scratch. Remaking a destroyed gadget requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work and 100 gil per engineer level. Only those who make a Knowledge (Engineering or Technology) DC 15 + the gadgeteer&rsquo;s engineer level may use these devices. The gadgeteer does not need to make a skill check, however. All gadgets attach to the wrist, one per gadget. Each gadget has a hardness equal to half the engineer&rsquo;s level (minimum 1) and an amount of hit points equal to half of the gadgeteer&rsquo;s maximum hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ballistic Shield: Requiring a swift action to activate, this gadget becomes a full-sized light tower shield, taking up a hand slot as well as a wrist slot. This gadget provides a damage reduction 3/- versus ranged attacks and half that (rounded down) versus other physical attacks as well as a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves versus area of effect spells and effects for the gadgeteer. The ballistic shield also provides the gadgeteer the normal shield bonus to AC as a tower shield, but without the penalties to attack rolls and armor check penalties. The gadgeteer is proficient with her own ballistic shield gadget, while anyone else who uses it must be proficient in tower shields to get its full effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chem Launcher: Requiring a swift action to activate, this gadget becomes a firearm able to shoot canisters of chemicals. The chem launcher begins with riot foam canisters, able to hold an ammo of 4. With a range of 30 feet, this gadget requires a ranged touch attack (using the gadgeteer&rsquo;s base attack bonus and her Intelligence modifier), and if struck, the target is immobilized for a number of rounds equal to the gadgeteer&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. The target may take a full-round action to use a Strength check (DC 10 + half of the engineer&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier) or an Escape Artist check (DC 15 + half of the engineer&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier) to break free. A canister costs 5 gil to replace. Reloading a chem launcher takes a full-round action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drone: Requiring a swift action to activate, when detached from the wrist, this gadget becomes a small flying drone (30&rsquo; flying speed, perfect maneuverability) able to assault the gadgeteer&rsquo;s enemies. The drone patrols within 50 feet of the gadgeteer, targeting enemies with its turret with a range of 50 feet, using the gadgeteer&rsquo;s base attack bonus and her Intelligence modifier. It deals 2d4 points of piercing damage and has an AC of 16 (+2 size bonus, +4 Dex bonus). It can hold an ammo cartridge of 40 and costs 40 gil to replace. Reloading a drone takes a full-round action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firefly: Requiring a swift action to activate, when detached from the wrist, this gadget becomes a small flying plane (50&rsquo; flying speed, perfect maneuverability), similar to the drone, that flies forward in a straight line up to 100 feet away, targeting up to 4 enemies within 30 feet of its flight plan. Once targeted, the firefly flashes a bright light, blinding targeted enemies for a number of rounds equal to the gadgeteer&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the engineer&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier) negates this status effect. Once the firefly has completed its flight plan, it returns to the gadgeteer and reattaches to her wrist.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hive: Requiring a swift action to activate, when detached from the wrist, this gadget becomes a small swarm of diminutive-size nano-bots (20&rsquo; flying speed, perfect maneuverability) that swarms the gadgeteer&rsquo;s enemies up to 50 feet away. The hive swarms the nearest enemy, dealing 1d6 points of lightning damage a round and inflicting the Static status effect while the target is in the swarm. In addition to its swarm traits, it also has the Distraction (DC 10 + half of the engineer&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier) ability. It has an AC of 18 (+4 size bonus, +4 Dex bonus).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pulse: Requiring a swift action to activate, the pulse scans the immediate area within a 30-ft.-radius of the gadgeteer of any living enemy creatures, even while in stealth, but not invisible creatures. Until the start of the gadgeteer&rsquo;s next turn, all enemies within the area of effect have a bright blue glow around them, granting the gadgeteer and her allies within 30 feet a +2 circumstance bonus on Attack rolls to attack them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seeker Mine: Requiring a swift action to activate, when detached from the wrist, this gadget becomes a ball of shrapnel that seeks out the closest enemy within 50 feet. When the seeker mine finds a target, it explodes with shrapnel, dealing 3d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures within 10 feet. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the engineer&rsquo;s level + his Intelligence modifier) reduces the damage by half. Once the seeker mine has depleted its supply of shrapnel, it becomes inert and must be refilled, costing 10 gil to replace. Reloading a seeker mine takes a full-round action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Turret: Requiring a swift action to activate, when detached from the wrist, this gadget becomes a miniature automated stationary turret mounted on a tripod which, after a slight delay, opens bursts of ballistic fire upon the targets within its vicinity. The turret can even be tossed (up to 30 feet away) to be set up at a distance from the gadgeteer to provide her with a tactical advantage during combat. The turret can even be deployed near the gadgeteer&rsquo;s feet to provide with cover should she be approached from behind by her enemies. This turret fires a burst of bullets, attacking all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the turret&rsquo;s space and extends to the limit of the weapon&rsquo;s range or until it strikes a barrier it cannot penetrate. The turret has a range increment of 100 feet and deals 2d6 points of piercing damage with a critical threat range of 20 / x4. When the turret attacks all creatures in a line, it makes a separate attack roll (using the gadgeteer&rsquo;s base attack bonus and her Intelligence modifier) against each creature in the line. Each creature in the line can only be attacked with one bullet from each burst. Each attack roll takes a &ndash;2 penalty to account for recoil. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil the turret&rsquo;s line attack. If any of the attack rolls threaten a critical hit, confirm the critical for that attack roll alone. A single attack from the turret fires 10 bullets and has a capacity of 40. An ammo cartridge costs 40 gil to replace. Reloading a turret takes a full-round action. The turret cannot fire single bullets that target one creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This ability replaces automaton.</p>","unidentified":""},"tags":["Equipment"],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","max":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"gadgets","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":["Engineer","Gadgeteer"]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"classSkills":{},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"soundEffect":"","nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"e1nAgjLmIKiSwmCp":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"ffd20","systemVersion":"10.2.4","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1667423417727,"modifiedTime":1694209593333,"lastModifiedBy":"VNk1dF8h7rdEhEd4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0}

This new mode uses a new canister that when the gadgeteer targets herself or an ally, she or that ally gain Fast Healing equal to the gadgeteer&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Drone</strong>: The drone can fire on three targets with a -3 penalty on all attack rolls and the damage increases to 4d4. In addition, the drone gains a +1 enhancement bonus and a +1 deflection bonus to AC. New mode: Defender. This new mode causes the drone to hover protectively around the gadgeteer, granting her a deflection bonus to AC and a damage reduction versus ranged weapons equal to her Intelligence modifier. In this mode, it does not engage targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Firefly</strong>: The number of creatures it can target increases to 8. In addition, those blinded take 2d6 points of fire damage per round until the blind status effect is negated. New mode: Burster. This new mode causes the firefly to attach explosive charges to targeted enemies instead. If the targets with the explosive charges come within 10 feet of each other, the charges explode immediately, dealing 5d6 points of fire damage in a 15-ft.-radius. All creatures including the targets will need to make a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the engineer&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier) to reduce the damage by half for each explosion.</p>\n<p><strong>Hive</strong>: The swarm&rsquo;s damage increases to 3d6. In addition, the swarm&rsquo;s fly speed increases to 40 feet and gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC. New mode: Restorer. This new mode restores hit points to creatures in the swarm equal to the swarm&rsquo;s damage and provides a deflection bonus to AC equal to its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Pulse</strong>: The bonus to attack rolls increases to +6. New mode: Jammer. This new mode allows the gadgeteer to emit an EMP pulse, causing all electrical devices (including automatons, robots, and other electrical gadgets) to be inoperable for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Seeker Mine</strong>: The damage increases to 9d6 and radius increases to 20 feet. New mode: Cluster. This new mode allows the gadgeteer to split seeker mine into smaller number of seeker mines equal to one-third the damage dice. It deals one-third the damage and half the damage radius.</p>\n<p><strong>Turret</strong>: The damage increases to 6d6. In addition, the turret gains a +1 enhancement bonus. New mode: Incinerator. This new mode causes the turret to project a 60-foot-long line of fire, attempting a separate attack roll against each creature within the line. Each attack roll takes a &ndash;2 penalty. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, vanish, or mirror image spells, do not foil this line attack. If any of the rolls threatens a critical hit, the turret confirms the critical for that roll alone. All affected creatures take fire damage equal to the turret&rsquo;s damage, and any creature hit by the flaming stream must also succeed at succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the engineer&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier) or catch fire, taking an additional fire damage equal to half the turret&rsquo;s damage each round until the flames are extinguished. A burning creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action, and dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +2 bonus on this save. A turret with full tanks is capable of unleashing up to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating effect. To refill, the gadgeteer will need to purchase a full tank (costing 50 gil). The tanks have hardness 10 and 5 hit points, and if the tank is ruptured in the presence of any adjacent flame (including the device&rsquo;s own gas igniter), a mighty conflagration erupts, the turret takes fire damage equal to the turret&rsquo;s damage, and all creatures within a 20-foot radius take fire damage equal to half of the turret&rsquo;s damage (Reflex DC 10 + half of the engineer&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier for half). Any creatures who take damage must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the engineer&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier) or catch on fire.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces automaton upgrade 2.</p>","unidentified":""},"tags":["Equipment"],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","max":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"gadgetUpgrade2","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":["Engineer","Gadgeteer"]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"classSkills":{},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"soundEffect":"","nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"e1nAgjLmIKiSwmCp":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"ffd20","systemVersion":"10.2.4","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1667423417752,"modifiedTime":1694209593334,"lastModifiedBy":"VNk1dF8h7rdEhEd4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0}

This space must be flat solid ground with no obstructions. Once deployed it immediately begins firing at its designated target as often as possible, taking all relevant penalties for doing so, using the engineer&rsquo;s base attack bonus + his Intelligence modifier and any bonuses present on the crossbow or its bolts. It loads and fires at the same speed as it normally takes to fire the crossbow normally and continues to fire until its magazine is empty or one minute passes. If the target is out of the turret&rsquo;s line of sight it ceases firing until the target is within sight again. An engineer can command a crossbow turret to change targets as a move action. The crossbow turret can remain activated for one minute before it must be recharged. A crossbow turret is recharged by operating the hand crank as a standard action to reset the mechanisms.

engineer.</p><h3 id=\"weapon-and-armor-proficiency\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3><p>Engineers are proficient with all simple weapons, all martial hammers, plus any type of non-exotic crossbows, and simple firearms. Engineers are proficient with light armor, but not with any type of shields.</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the engineer receives the Limit Breaks (Auto-Repair and Overdrive).</p><p><em>Auto-Repair (Su):</em> This Limit Break grants the engineer an aura that extends out to 30 feet around him. Any damaged items or machinery chosen by the engineer within the area of effect start repairing themselves at 4 hit points + an additional 4 hit points per four engineer levels after 1st for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four engineer levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><p><em>Overdrive (Su):</em> This Limit Break increases the overall combat effectiveness of the engineer’s automaton. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four engineer levels after 1st, the automaton gains a 2/- DR and +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. These bonuses increase by said amount per four engineer levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><h3 id=\"crafter\">Crafter (Ex)</h3><p>Few can match the engineer’s artifice when creating objects. At 1st level, an engineer gains a bonus equal to half his engineer level (minimum 1) to all Craft skill checks.</p><h3 id=\"repair\">Repair (Su)</h3><p class=\"western\">An engineer can fix broken items or his automaton with a mere touch. Starting at 1st level, as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the engineer repairs 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every other engineer level beyond first (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). In addition, one use of Repair restores an item affected by the broken condition. The engineer can repair a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier.</p><h3 id=\"technologist\">Technologist</h3><p>At 1st level, engineers receive the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/technology-feats/technologist/\">Technologist</a> feat for free.</p><h3 id=\"automaton\">Automaton (Ex)</h3><p>Many engineers create automatons capable of performing a host of duties. Whether or not the servitor is created from intricate clockwork, or steam driven pistons, they share the same capabilities. Unless granted a Master Upgrade, all automatons are unintelligent constructs that follow the engineer’s instructions unfailingly. At 5th and every five levels thereafter, the engineer upgrades an Automaton they currently possess in order to represent his growing skill and power. Upgrades must be performed in order and the engineer must meet the level requirements for the upgrade.</p><p>The capabilities granted by previous upgrades remain and stack with any improvements granted by the new upgrade. When installing a new upgrade, the engineer may reconfigure old design decisions, such as damage types, made at previous upgrades unless otherwise noted. If an Automaton is destroyed, the engineer must rebuild from scratch, costing him 100 gil per engineer level in material components, plus 200 gil per upgrade, to rebuild his Automaton. Remaking a destroyed Automaton requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work, plus 8 hours for each upgrade. In all other respects, this resembles the process for crafting a magic item. Upon creation, the engineer chooses the base form he wishes the Automaton to take from the following four types. This form may not be altered upon subsequent upgrades.  Then he adds to the base statistics bonuses based on his levels in engineer using Table 3-16: Automaton Base Statistics.</p><p><em>Aquatic</em></p><h5>Starting Statistics</h5><p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed:</strong> 20 ft., swim 40 ft.; <strong>AC:</strong> (see armor plating); <strong>Attack:</strong> bite (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str 19, Dex 12, Con –, Int –, Wis 10, Cha 10; <strong>Special Qualities:</strong> Construct traits, Lightning Vulnerability, Critical Hit Vulnerability.</p><p><em>Humanoid*</em></p><h5>Starting Statistics</h5><p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft.; <strong>AC:</strong> (see armor plating); <strong>Attack:</strong> slam (1d8); <strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str 17, Dex 14, Con –, Int –, Wis 10, Cha 10; <strong>Special Qualities:</strong> Construct traits, Lightning Vulnerability, Critical Hit Vulnerability.</p><p>*A humanoid Automaton has arms and hands.</p><p><em>Quadruped/Tracked/Wheeled</em></p><h5>Starting Statistics</h5><p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed:</strong> 50 ft.; <strong>AC:</strong> (see armor plating); <strong>Attack:</strong> slam (1d8); <strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str 15, Dex 15, Con –, Int –, Wis 10, Cha 10; <strong>Special Qualities:</strong> Construct traits, Lightning Vulnerability, Critical Hit Vulnerability.</p><p><em>Serpentine</em></p><h5>Starting Statistics</h5><p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed:</strong> 20 ft., climb 20 ft.; <strong>AC:</strong> (see armor plating); <strong>Attack:</strong> bite (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str 14, Dex 17, Con –, Int –, Wis 10, Cha 10; <strong>Special Qualities:</strong> Construct traits, Lightning Vulnerability, Critical Hit Vulnerability.<br></p><h2>Table: Automaton Base Statistics</h2><table><thead><tr class=\"row-1\"><th>Class Level</th><th>HD</th><th>BAB</th><th>Save</th><th>Armor Bonus</th><th>Saves Bonus</th><th>Special</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"row-2\"><td>1st</td><td>2</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>Armor Plating</td></tr><tr class=\"row-3\"><td>2nd</td><td>3</td><td>+3</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>Share Trick</td></tr><tr class=\"row-4\"><td>3rd</td><td>3</td><td>+3</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>—</td></tr><tr class=\"row-5\"><td>4th</td><td>4</td><td>+4</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>Ability Score Increase</td></tr><tr class=\"row-6\"><td>5th</td><td>5</td><td>+5</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>Automaton 1st Upgrade</td></tr><tr class=\"row-7\"><td>6th</td><td>6</td><td>+6</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr class=\"row-8\"><td>7th</td><td>6</td><td>+6</td><td>+2</td><td>+3</td><td>+3</td><td>Share Trick</td></tr><tr class=\"row-9\"><td>8th</td><td>7</td><td>+7</td><td>+3</td><td>+3</td><td>+3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr class=\"row-10\"><td>9th</td><td>8</td><td>+8</td><td>+3</td><td>+3</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Increase</td></tr><tr class=\"row-11\"><td>10th</td><td>9</td><td>+9</td><td>+3</td><td>+4</td><td>+4</td><td>Automaton 2nd Upgrade</td></tr><tr class=\"row-12\"><td>11th</td><td>9</td><td>+9</td><td>+4</td><td>+4</td><td>+4</td><td>—</td></tr><tr class=\"row-13\"><td>12th</td><td>10</td><td>+10</td><td>+4</td><td>+5</td><td>+5</td><td>Share Trick</td></tr><tr class=\"row-14\"><td>13th</td><td>11</td><td>+11</td><td>+4</td><td>+5</td><td>+5</td><td>—</td></tr><tr class=\"row-15\"><td>14th</td><td>12</td><td>+12</td><td>+5</td><td>+5</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Increase</td></tr><tr class=\"row-16\"><td>15th</td><td>12</td><td>+12</td><td>+5</td><td>+6</td><td>+6</td><td>Automaton 3rd Upgrade</td></tr><tr class=\"row-17\"><td>16th</td><td>13</td><td>+13</td><td>+5</td><td>+6</td><td>+6</td><td>—</td></tr><tr class=\"row-18\"><td>17th</td><td>14</td><td>+14</td><td>+6</td><td>+7</td><td>+7</td><td>Share Trick</td></tr><tr class=\"row-19\"><td>18th</td><td>15</td><td>+15</td><td>+6</td><td>+7</td><td>+7</td><td>—</td></tr><tr class=\"row-20\"><td>19th</td><td>15</td><td>+15</td><td>+6</td><td>+7</td><td>+7</td><td>—</td></tr><tr class=\"row-21\"><td>20th</td><td>16</td><td>+16</td><td>+7</td><td>+8</td><td>+8</td><td>Automaton Master Upgrade, Ability Score Increase</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Class Level:</em> The character’s engineer level. The engineer’s class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an automaton for the purpose of determining the automaton’s statistics.</p><p></p><p><em>HD:</em> This is the total number of 10 sided die (d10) Hit Dice the Automaton possesses. No Constitution modifier is applied to the Automaton’s hit points. The Automaton gets bonus hit points depending on its size: <strong>Medium</strong> 20 HP, <strong>Large</strong> 30 HP, <strong>Huge</strong> 40 HP.</p><p><em>BAB:</em> This is the automaton’s base attack bonus. Automatons do not gain additional attacks using their natural attack for a high base attack bonus.</p><p><em>Saves:</em> These are the automaton’s base saving throw bonuses. An automaton has poor saving throws.</p><p><em>Armor Bonus: </em>The number noted here is the Automaton’s base total armor bonus. This number is modified by the Automaton’s base form. An Automaton cannot wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the engineer’s operation of the Automaton. An engineer’s Automaton’s body can be enchanted as if it were armor. In addition, magic items interfere with the engineer’s connection to his automaton. As a result, the engineer and his automaton share magic item slots. For example, if the engineer is wearing a ring, his automaton can wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by the engineer remain active, and those used by the automaton become dormant. The automaton must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.</p><p><em>Saves Bonus: </em>Add this modifier as an equipment bonus to all of the Automaton’s saving throws.</p><p><em>Construct Traits:</em> Automatons count as <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct\">constructs</a> and have the following two weaknesses:</p><ul><li><strong>Vulnerable to Critical Hits</strong>: Whenever an automaton takes extra damage from a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>, it must make a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a> save to avoid being <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a> for 1 round. If it makes a successful saving throw, it is <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered\">staggered</a> for 1 round. The automaton remains immune to other sources of the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a> condition.</li><li><strong>Vulnerable to Lightning</strong>: Automatons take 150% as much damage as normal from lightning attacks, unless they are immune to lightning via other special defenses.</li></ul><p><em>Armor Plating (Ex): </em>At 1st level, the engineer chooses one of the following armor plating:</p><ul><li><strong>Heavy Armor Plating:</strong> Grants the Automaton a +8 armor bonus to AC (with a max Dexterity bonus of 0), but with a -10 ft. movement speed and a -2 Dexterity to starting Dexterity score.</li><li><strong>Medium Armor Plating:</strong> Grants the Automaton a +4 armor bonus to AC (with a max Dexterity bonus of +4).</li><li><strong>Light Armor Plating:</strong> Grants the Automaton a +2 armor bonus to AC (with no max Dexterity penalty), movement speed increases by 10-ft., and a +2 Dexterity to starting Dexterity score.</li></ul><p><em>Share Trick (Ex):</em> At 2nd level, the engineer selects a trick he knows. The Automaton gains the benefit of this engineer trick. If the engineer chooses to share a gadget, the Automaton uses its own abilities to determine its effects with the exception of any saving throw DCs it requires, which are calculated from the engineer’s abilities. At 7th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the engineer can select an additional trick to share.</p><p><em>Ability Score Increase (Ex): </em>The automaton adds +1 to any one of its ability scores.</p><p><em>Automaton Upgrade 1: </em>An engineer may add this upgrade to their Automaton at 5th level. Adding the first upgrade to an Automaton creates a telepathic link between the engineer and his creation. They can mentally communicate across any distance as long as they remain on the same plane. Communicating in this way is a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>. The engineer may choose to increase his Automaton by one size category, granting it a +4 size bonus to Strength and 10 additional hit points based on its size. In addition, it gains DR 5/- and the engineer may add a +2 equipment bonus to Strength or Dexterity to his automaton.</p><p><em>Automaton Upgrade 2:</em> An engineer may add this upgrade to their Automaton at 10th level. Adding the second upgrade allows the construct to make a second natural attack (as base form) during a full attack at the Automaton’s highest base attack bonus. It also gains a bonus feat from the following list, even if it would not normally qualify: Great Fortitude, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, or Toughness. In addition, the engineer may add a +2 equipment bonus to Strength or Dexterity to his automaton.</p><p><em>Automaton Upgrade 3:</em> An engineer may add this upgrade to their Automaton at 15th level. Adding the third upgrade to the Automaton grants it the use of an elemental energy attack. At the time of the upgrade the engineer chooses from fire, ice or lightning elemental energy and picks either a 60 ft. line or 30 ft. cone, inflicting 4d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 2 HD the Automaton possesses. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1 per 2 HD the Automaton possesses + the engineer’s Intelligence modifier) halves the damage. This ability is usable once every 1d4 rounds and cannot be changed until the Automaton is upgraded again. In addition, the engineer can choose to increase his Automaton by one size category, granting it an additional +4 size bonus to Strength and 10 additional hit points based on its size. The maximum size of an Automaton is Huge. The Automaton also gains the Grab special attack on all of its slam attacks. In addition, the engineer may add a +2 equipment bonus to Strength or Dexterity to his automaton.</p><p><em>Automaton Master Upgrade:</em> An engineer may add this upgrade to their Automaton at 20th level. Adding the fourth upgrade gives the Automaton an Intelligence score of 10. It can now act upon its own volition, but always according to the intention of its creator, gaining an identical alignment as the creator’s at the moment it gained sentience. It gains feats appropriate to its hit dice and 2 skill points per hit dice, treating any skill the engineer has ranks in as a class skill. The engineer may also increase the size of the Automaton once more (to a maximum of Huge), and change the Automaton’s elemental energy attack to earth, water or wind damage. In addition, the Automaton’s DR increases to 10/- and the engineer may add a +2 equipment bonus to Strength or Dexterity to his automaton.</p><h3 id=\"tinkering\">Tinkering (Ex)</h3><p>When it comes to tearing apart salvage, engineers are highly adept. By 2nd level, engineers become so used to tinkering with machinery that they come to understand the finer points of trap mechanisms. An engineer adds half of his engineer level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). An engineer can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p><h3 id=\"combat-awareness\">Combat Awareness (Ex)</h3><p>At 2nd level, an engineer is ready to spring into action at a moment’s notice. He gains his Intelligence modifier as a bonus on all initiative rolls.</p><h3 id=\"engineer-tricks\">Engineer Tricks</h3><p>At 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, an engineer learns a technical innovation called an engineer trick. These engineer tricks come in three forms: augmentations, gadgets, or techniques. Unless otherwise noted, an engineer cannot select an individual engineer trick more than once. Some engineer tricks can only be received if the engineer has met certain prerequisites first, such as learning other engineer tricks. The DC of any saving throw called for by an engineer trick is equal to 10 + half of the engineer’s level + his Intelligence modifier.</p><ul><li>Augmentations are engineer tricks that enhance or otherwise add on to an Automaton.</li><li>Gadgets are tangible items that engineers can craft. Generally, they are only usable a certain number of times per day and some require the engineer to provide some form of fuel. Only the engineer knows the peculiarities of their function, preventing others from using them. Unless otherwise noted, they are all Tiny items with AC 10 (when not being held); hardness 5 and 10 HP. If a gadget is lost or destroyed the engineer may spend 100 gil and 8 hours of work in order to rebuild it.</li><li>Techniques are tricks that the engineer has learned that are not tied to any single item, however many require an item to be used in conjunction with them.</li></ul><ul><li>A complete list of engineer tricks can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/engineer/engineer-tricks/\">Engineer Tricks</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"rough-and-ready\">Rough and Ready (Ex)</h3><p><strong> </strong>At 3rd level, the engineer has trained with activating his gadgets under pressure that it becomes almost intuition to bring them to bear as his hands move with blinding speed. Once per day, the engineer can activate a single gadget that requires a standard action to activate as a swift action. At 7th level and every four levels beyond, the engineer can use this ability one additional time per day to a maximum of 4 times per day at 15th level.</p><h3 id=\"salvage\">Salvage (Ex)</h3><div class=\"flex-container\"><div class=\"flex-left-section\"><p>At 3rd level, the engineer can salvage electrical and mechanical parts from destroyed vehicles, constructs, and airships. Salvaging a destroyed vehicle, construct, or airship takes time as noted in the table below. At the end of this time, the engineer makes a Perception check. If the check succeeds, he gains gil equal to the amount indicated on the table below. A particular vehicle, construct, or airship can be successfully salvaged only once. Any further attempts to salvage the wreckage fail automatically.</p></div><div class=\"flex-right-section\"><h2>Table: Salvage (Vehicle, Construct, and Airship)</h2><table><thead><tr class=\"row-1\"><th>Size</th><th>Time Required</th><th>Perception Check DC</th><th>Gil</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"row-2\"><td>Tiny to Small</td><td>10 minutes</td><td>10</td><td>500</td></tr><tr class=\"row-3\"><td>Medium</td><td>30 minutes</td><td>15</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr class=\"row-4\"><td>Large</td><td>1 hour</td><td>20</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr class=\"row-5\"><td>Huge</td><td>3 hours</td><td>25</td><td>4,000</td></tr><tr class=\"row-6\"><td>Gargantuan</td><td>6 hours</td><td>30</td><td>8,000</td></tr><tr class=\"row-7\"><td>Colossal</td><td>12 hours</td><td>35</td><td>16,000</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3 id=\"demolish\">Demolish (Ex)</h3><p>At 3rd level, an engineer has come to understand the key workings of mechanical devices and constructs so well that he can strike constructs or machinery for an additional +1d6 points of damage as long as he is using a blunt or piercing melee weapon. This increases by +1d6 every three levels after 3rd (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th). In addition, the engineer can ignore up to 3 points of hardness/damage reduction against any construct. This increases by 3 every three levels after 3rd.</p><h3 id=\"jury-rig\">Jury-Rig (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 4th level, the engineer gains <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/field-repair/\">Field Repair</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the feat’s prerequisites. In addition, the engineer can make temporary repairs to broken technology on the fly. Jury-rigging a broken object (including a vehicle’s driving devices or engines) has a Craft DC equal to the Disable Device DC to disable a device of the same complexity, and requires the same amount of time; the Craft skill for this check must be relevant to the object being jury-rigged. If the check is successful, the object is relieved of the broken condition for up to 5 minutes. If a jury-rigged object takes any damage, it regains the broken condition. A jury-rigged object cannot benefit from this ability again until it has been repaired.</p><h3 id=\"support-droid\">Support Droid (Ex)</h3><p>At 4th level, an engineer can build a support droid. Support droids, like Automatons, are unintelligent constructs that follow the engineer’s instructions unfailingly. If a support droid is destroyed, the engineer must rebuild from scratch, costing him 100 gil per hit dice in material components, to rebuild his support droid. Remaking a destroyed support droid requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work.</p><p><em>Support Droid</em></p><h5>Starting Statistics</h5><p><strong>Size:</strong> Tiny; <strong>Speed: </strong>Fly 30 ft.

The engineer’s class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to a support droid for the purpose of determining the support droid’s statistics.</p><p></p><p><em>HD:</em> This is the total number of ten-sided (d10) Hit Dice the support droid possesses.</p><p><em>BAB:</em> This is the support droid’s base attack bonus.</p><p><em>Saves:</em> These are the support droid’s base saving throw bonuses. A support droid has poor saving throws.</p><p><em>Armor Bonus:</em> The number noted here is the Support Droid’s base total armor bonus. This number is modified by the Support Droid’s base form. A Support Droid cannot wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the engineer’s operation of the Support Droid. An engineer can enchant his Support Droid’s body as if it were armor.</p><p><em>Saves Bonus:</em> Add this modifier to the Support Droid’s saving throws.</p><p>The support droid has no combat capabilities until level 12, but possesses two different support modes (Repair and Shield) at a 30 foot range.</p><ul><li><strong>Repair (Ex):</strong> In Repair mode, the support droid will start repairing the automaton or any designated machinery the engineer commanded it to fix. The support droid repairs 1 damage per HD it possesses for a duration of 1 round per engineer level. While repairing, it can only take <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a>s. If all of the duration is used up for repairing, it must wait 1d4 rounds to regain the energy to repair.</li><li><strong>Shield (Ex):</strong> In Shield mode, the support droid will shield an ally with a protective barrier. The support droid encases the designated ally the engineer commanded it to with a protective barrier that does the following: +1 deflection bonus to AC, +1 morale bonus to saving throws, and DR 1/- per two HD it possesses for a duration of 1 round per engineer level. While shielding, it can only take <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a>s. If all of the duration is used up for shielding, it must wait 1d4 rounds to regain the energy to shield.</li></ul><p><em>Fine-Tuning (Ex):</em> The support droid gains the <em>Evasion</em> ability. If it makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage.</p><p><em>Support Droid Upgrade 1: </em>An engineer may add this upgrade to their Support Droid at 8th level. Adding the first upgrade to a Support Droid creates a telepathic link between the engineer and his creation. They can mentally communicate across any distance as long as they remain on the same plane. Communicating in this way is a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>. The engineer may improve his Support Droid with the following abilities: Increase Flight Speed by 30 feet, Increase Dexterity Score by 2, Grant the Support Droid a Feat (must meet prerequisites), or Grant the Support Droid a DR of 1/-.</p><p><em>Improved Fine-Tuning (Ex):</em> The support droid gains the <em>Improved</em> <em>Evasion</em> ability. Even if it fails a Reflex saving throw against an attack, it takes half damage.</p><p><em>Support Droid Upgrade 2:</em> An engineer may add this upgrade to their Support Droid at 12th level. The Support Droid gains a new mode, Attack. This new combat mode allows the Support Droid to fire a ray of plasma with a range of 50 feet. In addition, the engineer may improve his Support Droid with any of the abilities from the 1st upgrade.</p><ul><li><strong>Attack (Ex):</strong> In Attack mode, the support droid will start blasting a target creature the engineer commanded it to attack. The support droid uses a ranged touch attack and deals 1d6 points of half fire/half lightning damage per two HD it possesses for a duration of 1 round per engineer level. While attacking, it cannot take any other actions. If all of the duration is used up for attacking, it must wait 1d4 rounds to regain the energy to attack.</li></ul><p><em>Stout Servant (Ex):</em> The support droid is more durable and resilient. The support droid gains DR 5/-. This damage reduction stacks with any support droid upgrades.</p><p><em>Support Droid Upgrade 3:</em> An engineer may add this upgrade to their Support Droid at 16th level. The Support Droid gains a new mode, Disrupt. This new combat mode allows the Support Droid to focus a beam of disruption energy that becomes a hindrance to any targeted spell-casters with a range of 50 feet. In addition, the engineer may improve his Support Droid with any of the abilities from the 1st upgrade.</p><ul><li><strong>Disrupt (Ex):</strong> In Disrupt mode, the support droid will fire a concentrated beam of disruption energy at a target spell-caster the engineer commanded it to disrupt. The support droid causes the spell-caster to make concentration checks to cast spells with a –1 penalty for every two HD it possesses for a duration of 1 round per engineer level. In addition, the target must pay an additional MP for any successful cast spell. While disrupting, it can only take <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a>s. If all of the duration is used up for disrupting, it must wait 1d4 rounds to regain the energy to disrupt.</li></ul><p><em>Support Droid Master Upgrade:</em> An engineer may add this upgrade to their Support Droid at 20th level. Adding the fourth upgrade to the support droid increases its senses. The support droid can now see invisible creatures and objects. It has a darkvision of 120 feet as well as low-light vision. It also gains a force field. A force field sheathes the support droid in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants 50 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a support droid with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the support droid is immune to critical hits. A force field has fast healing 10, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours. In addition, the engineer may improve his Support Droid with any of the abilities from the 1st upgrade.</p><h3 id=\"crafting-expertise\">Crafting Expertise</h3><p>At 5th level, the engineer gains <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/master-craftsman-final/\">Master Craftsman</a> as a bonus feat.</p><h3 id=\"quick-craft\">Quick Craft (Ex)</h3><p>At 7th level, an engineer learns how to craft ordinary scratch-built items more quickly than normal. The engineer reduces the building time of ordinary objects and masterwork objects by half.</p><h3 id=\"durable-materials\">Durable Materials (Ex)</h3><p>At 8th level, the engineer learns how to build for durability and toughness. Any item crafted by the engineer receives a bonus to hit points equal to the level of the engineer at the time of its creation.</p><h3 id=\"salvage-expert\">Salvage Expert (Ex)</h3><p>At 10th level, the engineer has gotten so good at keeping an eye out for spare parts that he can always decrease the cost of repairs or construction by 25%. In addition, when using the Salvage ability, the engineer gains a competence bonus on his Perception checks equal to half of his engineer level.</p><h3 id=\"unflustered\">Unflustered (Ex)</h3><p>An 11th-level engineer can perform complicated tasks without provoking attacks of opportunity from adjacent foes. During any round in which the engineer uses the Craft, Disable Device, or Repair skill, he can first make a concentration check (DC 15, using the engineer’s level as his caster level) to use the desired skill without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p><h3 id=\"precise-timing\">Precise Timing (Ex)</h3><p>At 13th level, the mechanical timing of a construct or automaton becomes incredibly predictable to someone intimate with how machines act and move. The engineer is now so familiar with this timing that he can never be caught flat-footed by a construct, and gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC against them as well.</p><h3 id=\"master-mechanic\">Master Mechanic (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 14th level, the engineer becomes fully experienced in the art of quick repairs and mechanical tinkering, even under pressure. The engineer can always take 10 on his jury-rig check or when using Disable Device, even when under adverse conditions. In addition, the engineer can make repairs or disable a device with masterful speed. He can make repairs on an object or vehicle in half the normal amount of time (repairing double the normal amount of damage per day of work). Furthermore, Simple devices can be disabled as a standard action, Tricky can be disabled in 1d2 rounds, and Difficult and Extreme devices can be disabled in 1d4+1 rounds.</p><h3 id=\"rapid-rebuild\">Rapid Rebuild (Ex)</h3><p>At 15th level, the engineer becomes faster at making things he is familiar with. As long as he has built something once in the past, he may rebuild it in half the time it would take to build normally.</p><h3 id=\"construct-expertise\">Construct Expertise</h3><p>At 15th level, the engineer gains the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/craft-construct-item-creation/\">Craft Construct</a> feat. The engineer does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. He uses his engineer levels as his effective caster level when creating constructs. The engineer can eschew spells needed to craft a construct, but the costs to craft are doubled, or he must have access to the prerequisite spells, either through use of a magical item or cast by another spellcaster.</p><h3 id=\"clockwork-mimicries\">Clockwork Mimicries (Ex)</h3><p>At 16th level, an engineer can use his mechanical mastery to create clockwork mimicries of powerful magic items. Doing so takes 1 hour of uninterrupted work, and allows the engineer to create a wondrous item that functions for a number of hours per day equal to his engineer level. When creating such a clockwork item, the engineer must use materials worth an amount equal to the wondrous item’s construction cost. He need not meet any of the item’s other creation requirements. An engineer cannot create a mimicry of a consumable wondrous item or a wondrous item with finite charges, and he can have only one mimicry at a time. The clockwork item never functions as a wondrous item for any other creature.</p><h3 id=\"master-engineer\">Master Engineer (Ex)</h3><p>At 17th level, the engineer’s expertise with dealing with crafting and repairing becomes exceedingly easy. The engineer is considered always taking 10 on any Craft and Repair checks. The engineer can also take 20 in half the time.</p><h3 id=\"primal-technomancy\">Primal Technomancy (Su)</h3><p>Beginning at 19th level, an engineer can choose to use a scroll without consuming it or a wand/materia without expending a charge. Whenever he uses the Use Magic Device skill to activate a scroll or a wand he may add an additional +10 to the DC. If he fails this check the charge or scroll is expended as if he failed to activate the item. If he succeeds the scroll or wand is used but is not expended.</p><h3 id=\"one-with-machines\">One With Machines (Ex)</h3><p>At 20th level, the engineer floods his body with nanobots. The engineer becomes immune to poison and diseases. He also gains Fast Healing 5. In addition, the engineer may use the Repair ability upon himself as if he were a construct. Once per day, these nanobots can bring the engineer back to life as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/r/raise/\"><em>Raise</em></a> spell. The engineer will no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue. When the engineer’s natural life span is reached, the biology inside it fails, and its remaining systems become a construct with all of the same stats it had in life, but it no longer has independent thought.</p><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.

This brown ooze can be used as a poison coating that causes victims to contract filth fever. If the water contained another disease or poison, this coating also causes that effect with the same DC as the original poison or disease. The filth gatherer is Small, and it has hardness 8 and 30 hit points. It weighs 50 pounds while empty.</p>","unidentified":""},"tags":["Engineer"],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","max":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"gadgetEngineerTrickFilthGathererEx","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":["Engineer"]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"classSkills":{},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"soundEffect":"","nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"N1fw6b6C7kQcxuhL":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"ffd20","systemVersion":"10.2.4","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1667423417857,"modifiedTime":1694209593338,"lastModifiedBy":"VNk1dF8h7rdEhEd4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0}

Whether or not the servitor is created from intricate clockwork, or steam driven pistons, they share the same capabilities. Unless granted a Master Upgrade, all automatons are unintelligent constructs that follow the engineer&rsquo;s instructions unfailingly. At 5th and every five levels thereafter, the engineer upgrades an Automaton they currently possess in order to represent his growing skill and power. Upgrades must be performed in order and the engineer must meet the level requirements for the upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The capabilities granted by previous upgrades remain and stack with any improvements granted by the new upgrade. When installing a new upgrade, the engineer may reconfigure old design decisions, such as damage types, made at previous upgrades unless otherwise noted. If an Automaton is destroyed, the engineer must rebuild from scratch, costing him 100 gil per engineer level in material components, plus 200 gil per upgrade, to rebuild his Automaton. Remaking a destroyed Automaton requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work, plus 8 hours for each upgrade. In all other respects, this resembles the process for crafting a magic item. Upon creation, the engineer chooses the base form he wishes the Automaton to take from the following four types. This form may not be altered upon subsequent upgrades.&nbsp; Then he adds to the base statistics bonuses based on his levels in engineer using Table 3-16: Automaton Base Statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aquatic</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>STARTING STATISTICS</p>\n<p>Size: Medium;

The engineer&rsquo;s class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an automaton for the purpose of determining the automaton&rsquo;s statistics.</p>\n<p>HD: This is the total number of 10 sided die (d10) Hit Dice the Automaton possesses. No Constitution modifier is applied to the Automaton&rsquo;s hit points. The Automaton gets bonus hit points depending on its size: Medium 20 HP, Large 30 HP, Huge 40 HP.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BAB: This is the automaton&rsquo;s base attack bonus. Automatons do not gain additional attacks using their natural attack for a high base attack bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Saves: These are the automaton&rsquo;s base saving throw bonuses. An automaton has poor saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Armor Bonus: The number noted here is the Automaton&rsquo;s base total armor bonus. This number is modified by the Automaton&rsquo;s base form. An Automaton cannot wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the engineer&rsquo;s operation of the Automaton. An engineer can enchant his Automaton&rsquo;s body as if it were armor. In addition, magic items interfere with the engineer&rsquo;s connection to his automaton. As a result, the engineer nd his automaton share magic item slots. For example, if the engineer is wearing a ring, his automaton can wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by the engineer remain active, and those used by the automaton become dormant. The automaton must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Saves Bonus: Add this modifier as an equipment bonus to all of the Automaton&rsquo;s saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Construct Traits: Automatons count as constructs and have the following two weaknesses:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vulnerable to Critical Hits: Whenever an automaton takes extra damage from a critical hit, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. If it makes a successful saving throw, it is staggered for 1 round. The automaton remains immune to other sources of the stunned condition.</p>\n<p>Vulnerable to Lightning: Automatons take 150% as much damage as normal from lightning attacks, unless they are immune to lightning via other special defenses.</p>\n<p>Armor Plating (Ex): At 1st level, the engineer chooses one of the following armor plating:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Heavy Armor Plating: Grants the Automaton a +8 armor bonus to AC (with a max Dexterity bonus of 0), but with a -10 ft. movement speed and a -2 Dexterity to starting Dexterity score.</p>\n<p>Medium Armor Plating: Grants the Automaton a +4 armor bonus to AC (with a max Dexterity bonus of +4).</p>\n<p>Light Armor Plating: Grants the Automaton a +2 armor bonus to AC (with no max Dexterity penalty), movement speed increases by 10-ft., and a +2 Dexterity to starting Dexterity score.</p>\n<p>Share Trick (Ex): At 2nd level, the engineer selects a trick he knows. The Automaton gains the benefit of this engineer trick. If the engineer chooses to share a gadget, the Automaton uses its own abilities to determine its effects with the exception of any saving throw DCs it requires, which are calculated from the engineer&rsquo;s abilities. At 7th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the engineer can select an additional trick to share.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ability Score Increase (Ex): The automaton adds +1 to any one of its ability scores.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Automaton Upgrade 1: An engineer may add this upgrade to their Automaton at 5th level. Adding the first upgrade to an Automaton creates a telepathic link between the engineer and his creation. They can mentally communicate across any distance as long as they remain on the same plane. Communicating in this way is a free action. The engineer may choose to increase his Automaton by one size category, granting it a +4 size bonus to Strength and 10 additional hit points based on its size. In addition, it gains DR 5/- and the engineer may add a +2 equipment bonus to Strength or Dexterity to his automaton.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Automaton Upgrade 2: An engineer may add this upgrade to their Automaton at 10th level. Adding the second upgrade allows the construct to make a second natural attack (as base form) during a full attack at the Automaton&rsquo;s highest base attack bonus. It also gains a bonus feat from the following list, even if it would not normally qualify: Great Fortitude, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, or Toughness. In addition, the engineer may add a +2 equipment bonus to Strength or Dexterity to his automaton.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Automaton Upgrade 3: An engineer may add this upgrade to their Automaton at 15th level. Adding the third upgrade to the Automaton grants it the use of an elemental energy attack. At the time of the upgrade the engineer chooses from fire, ice or lightning elemental energy and picks either a 60 ft. line or 30 ft. cone, inflicting 4d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 2 HD the Automaton possesses. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1 per 2 HD the Automaton possesses) halves the damage. This ability is usable once every 1d4 rounds and cannot be changed until the Automaton is upgraded again. In addition, the engineer can choose to increase his Automaton by one size category, granting it an additional +4 size bonus to Strength and 10 additional hit points based on its size. The maximum size of an Automaton is Huge. The Automaton also gains the Grab special attack on all of its slam attacks. In addition, the engineer may add a +2 equipment bonus to Strength or Dexterity to his automaton.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Automaton Master Upgrade: An engineer may add this upgrade to their Automaton at 20th level. Adding the fourth upgrade gives the Automaton an Intelligence score of 10. It can now act upon its own volition, but always according to the intention of its creator, gaining an identical alignment as the creator&rsquo;s at the moment it gained sentience. It gains feats appropriate to its hit dice and 2 skill points per hit dice, treating any skill the engineer has ranks in as a class skill. The engineer may also increase the size of the Automaton once more (to a maximum of Huge), and change the Automaton&rsquo;s elemental energy attack to earth, water or wind damage. In addition, the Automaton&rsquo;s DR increases to 10/- and the engineer may add a +2 equipment bonus to Strength or Dexterity to his automaton.</p>","unidentified":""},"tags":["Automaton"],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","max":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"automaton","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":["Engineer"]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"classSkills":{},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"soundEffect":"","nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"e1nAgjLmIKiSwmCp":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"ffd20","systemVersion":"10.2.4","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1667423417866,"modifiedTime":1694209593339,"lastModifiedBy":"VNk1dF8h7rdEhEd4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0}

It goes from being a sleek, streamlined 12-inch bar to being a 30-inch bar, fold-able to 15-inches. Alongside the normal capabilities of the Utility Tool (folding, twisting, and manipulating it into an innumerable amount of tools), the addition of these new panels and edges allows it to be changed into any melee weapon the Engineer has seen and is proficient in. The lack of specific parts still prevents the Utility Tool from creating complex items like crossbows or firearms, but it can become any type of one-handed melee weapon, including emulating any combat tricks the weapon is capable of. It takes a full-round action to change the tool from a normal tool to a weaponized tool and from one damage type to another, and a standard action to change one weapon into another of the same damage type. With the process of adding plates and parts, the Battle-Ready Utility Tool now weighs 10 lbs. and has a hardness of 5 and 20 hit points.

The engineer&rsquo;s class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to a support droid for the purpose of determining the support droid&rsquo;s statistics.</p>\n<p>HD: This is the total number of ten-sided (d10) Hit Dice the support droid possesses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BAB: This is the support droid&rsquo;s base attack bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Saves: These are the support droid&rsquo;s base saving throw bonuses. A support droid has poor saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Armor Bonus: The number noted here is the Support Droid&rsquo;s base total armor bonus. This number is modified by the Support Droid&rsquo;s base form. A Support Droid cannot wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the engineer&rsquo;s operation of the Support Droid. An engineer can enchant his Support Droid&rsquo;s body as if it were armor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Saves Bonus: Add this modifier to the Support Droid&rsquo;s saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The support droid has no combat capabilities until level 12, but possesses two different support modes (Repair and Shield) at a 30 foot range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Repair (Ex): In Repair mode, the support droid will start repairing the automaton or any designated machinery the engineer commanded it to fix. The support droid repairs 1 damage per HD it possesses for a duration of 1 round per engineer level. While repairing, it can only take move actions. If all of the duration is used up for repairing, it must wait 1d4 rounds to regain the energy to repair.</p>\n<p>Shield (Ex): In Shield mode, the support droid will shield an ally with a protective barrier. The support droid encases the designated ally the engineer commanded it to with a protective barrier that does the following: +1 deflection bonus to AC, +1 morale bonus to saving throws, and DR 1/- per two HD it possesses for a duration of 1 round per engineer level. While shielding, it can only take move actions. If all of the duration is used up for shielding, it must wait 1d4 rounds to regain the energy to shield.</p>\n<p>Fine-Tuning (Ex): The support droid gains the Evasion ability. If it makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Support Droid Upgrade 1: An engineer may add this upgrade to their Support Droid at 8th level. Adding the first upgrade to a Support Droid creates a telepathic link between the engineer and his creation. They can mentally communicate across any distance as long as they remain on the same plane. Communicating in this way is a free action. The engineer may improve his Support Droid with the following abilities: Increase Flight Speed by 30 feet, Increase Dexterity Score by 2, Grant the Support Droid a Feat (must meet prerequisites), or Grant the Support Droid a DR of 1/-.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Improved Fine-Tuning (Ex): The support droid gains the Improved Evasion ability. Even if it fails a Reflex saving throw against an attack, it takes half damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Support Droid Upgrade 2: An engineer may add this upgrade to their Support Droid at 12th level. The Support Droid gains a new mode, Attack. This new combat mode allows the Support Droid to fire a ray of plasma with a range of 50 feet. In addition, the engineer may improve his Support Droid with any of the abilities from the 1st upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attack (Ex): In Attack mode, the support droid will start blasting a target creature the engineer commanded it to attack. The support droid uses a ranged touch attack and deals 1d6 points of half fire/half lightning damage per two HD it possesses for a duration of 1 round per engineer level. While attacking, it cannot take any other actions. If all of the duration is used up for attacking, it must wait 1d4 rounds to regain the energy to attack.</p>\n<p>Stout Servant (Ex): The support droid is more durable and resilient. The support droid gains DR 5/-. This damage reduction stacks with any support droid upgrades.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Support Droid Upgrade 3: An engineer may add this upgrade to their Support Droid at 16th level. The Support Droid gains a new mode, Disrupt. This new combat mode allows the Support Droid to focus a beam of disruption energy that becomes a hindrance to any targeted spell-casters with a range of 50 feet. In addition, the engineer may improve his Support Droid with any of the abilities from the 1st upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disrupt (Ex): In Disrupt mode, the support droid will fire a concentrated beam of disruption energy at a target spell-caster the engineer commanded it to disrupt. The support droid causes the spell-caster to make concentration checks to cast spells with a &ndash;1 penalty for every two HD it possesses for a duration of 1 round per engineer level. In addition, the target must pay an additional MP for any successful casted spell. While disrupting, it can only take move actions. If all of the duration is used up for disrupting, it must wait 1d4 rounds to regain the energy to disrupt.</p>\n<p>Support Droid Master Upgrade: An engineer may add this upgrade to their Support Droid at 20th level. Adding the fourth upgrade to the support droid increases its senses. The support droid can now see invisible creatures and objects. It has a darkvision of 120 feet as well as low-light vision. It also gains a force field. A force field sheathes the support droid in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants 50 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a support droid with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the support droid is immune to critical hits. A force field has fast healing 10, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours. In addition, the engineer may improve his Support Droid with any of the abilities from the 1st upgrade.</p>","unidentified":""},"tags":["Construct"],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","max":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"supportDroid","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":["Engineer"]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"classSkills":{},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"soundEffect":"","nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"e1nAgjLmIKiSwmCp":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"ffd20","systemVersion":"10.2.4","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1667423417896,"modifiedTime":1694209593340,"lastModifiedBy":"VNk1dF8h7rdEhEd4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0}

The engineer chooses which type of turret and may convert any or all of his crossbow turrets into it. Each time this engineer trick is chosen, the engineer can pick a different turret type.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flamethrower Turret: This turret projects a 60-foot-long line of fire, attempting a separate attack roll against each creature within the line. Each attack roll takes a &ndash;2 penalty. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil this line attack. If any of the rolls threatens a critical hit, the turret confirms the critical for that roll alone. All affected creatures take 4d6 points of fire damage, and any creature hit by the flaming stream must also succeed at succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or catch fire, taking an additional 2d6 points of fire damage each round until the flames are extinguished. A burning creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action, and dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +2 bonus on this save. A flamethrower turret with full tanks is capable of unleashing up to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating effect. To refill, the engineer will need to purchase a full tank (costing 50 gil). The tanks have hardness 10 and 5 hit points, and if the tank is ruptured in the presence of any adjacent flame (including the device&rsquo;s own gas igniter), a mighty conflagration erupts, the turret takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and all creatures within a 20-foot radius take 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 for half). Any creatures who take damage must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or catch on fire. A flamethrower turret has hardness 10 and 35 hit points. Building a flamethrower turret costs 500 gil.</p>\n<p>Minigun Turret: This turret fires a burst of bullets, attacking all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the turret&rsquo;s space and extends to the limit of the weapon&rsquo;s range or until it strikes a barrier it cannot penetrate. The turret has a range increment of 100 ft. and deals 2d6 points of piercing damage with a critical threat range of 20 / x4. When the minigun turret attacks all creatures in a line, it makes a separate attack roll against each creature in the line. Each creature in the line can only be attacked with one bullet from each burst. Each attack roll takes a &ndash;2 penalty to account for recoil. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil the minigun turret&rsquo;s line attack. If any of the attack rolls threaten a critical hit, confirm the critical for that attack roll alone. A single attack from the minigun turret fires 10 bullets and has a capacity of 40. An ammo cartridge costs 40 gil to replace. Reloading a minigun turret takes a full-round action. The minigun turret cannot fire single bullets that target one creature. A minigun turret has hardness 10 and 35 hit points. Building a minigun launcher turret costs 500 gil.</p>\n<p>Mortar Turret: This turret is an indirect-fire advanced siege firearm, consisting of a heavy steel barrel, a loading mechanism, and a folding bipod stand, and is used to launch explosives to penetrate enemy defensive lines. It has a range of 250 ft. with a minimum range of 50 ft. A mortar turret has a capacity of 6 and reloading the mortar is a full-round action. The engineer loads a grenade-like projectile into the breach of the weapon&rsquo;s steel barrel, along with a blank rifle round that propels the bomb when triggered. The weapon uses indirect fire to lob bombs in slow-moving, high arcs, and the engineer targets a specific square. Mortar turrets can also be fired as direct-fire siege engines. When used for direct fire, it takes a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls and their range increment is halved, but they do not have a minimum range. After the point of impact is determined, the shell explodes and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage to all creatures in a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 20 for half). A mortar turret has hardness 10 and 35 hit points; it fires special, finned fragmentation bombs that cost 10 gil each and weigh 4 pounds each. Building a mortar launcher turret costs 500 gil.</p>\n<p>Rocket Launcher Turret: This turret contains its entire load of rockets and energy charges. The rocket launcher turret has a range increment of 120 ft. Rockets fired from a rocket launcher turret can target a single target or a grid intersection. A creature that takes a direct hit from a rocket cannot attempt a saving throw to reduce the damage taken. When a rocket strikes its target, it explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 12d6 points of fire and bludgeoning damage to all creatures within that area of effect&mdash;a successful DC 20 Reflex save halves the damage for all but the target. A rocket launcher turret has hardness 10 and 35 hit points; it fires rockets that cost 100 gil each and weigh 8 pounds each. A rocket launcher turret has a capacity of 10 and reloading a rocket launcher turret takes a full-round action. Building a rocket launcher turret costs 1,000 gil.</p>","unidentified":""},"tags":["Engineer"],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","max":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"gadgetEngineerTrickTurretUpgradeEx","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":["Engineer"]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"classSkills":{},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"soundEffect":"","nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"N1fw6b6C7kQcxuhL":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"ffd20","systemVersion":"10.2.4","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1667423417918,"modifiedTime":1694209593341,"lastModifiedBy":"VNk1dF8h7rdEhEd4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0}

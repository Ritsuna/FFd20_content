of the following are class features of the white mage.</p><h3 id=\"weapon-and-armor-proficiency\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3><p>White Mages are proficient with the club, sling, power rod, power staff, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Heavier armor interferes with a white mage’s movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the white mage receives the Limit Breaks (Breath of the Earth and Pulse of Life).</p><p><em>Breath of the Earth (Su): </em>This Limit Break causes the earth to rupture partially and releases a warm wind encompassing white mage and her allies within 30 feet, curing any negative status effects each round (from 1st-7th level, cures 3rd level or lower status effects, 8th-15th level, cures 6th level or lower status effects, 16th-20th level, cures any status effects). This Limit Break lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four white mage levels after 1st.</p><p><em>Pulse of Life (Su): </em>This Limit Break causes an intense burst of angelic light to pulse through the white mage and her allies within 30 feet, healing for 2d10 points of damage + an additional 2d10 per four white mage levels after 1st and providing a Fast Healing 2 that increases by 2 per four white mage levels after 1st and lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four white mage levels after 1st. Any affected allies that are unconscious and brought to consciousness as a result of the initial healing and are prone are immediately brought to their feet (this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity).</p><h3 id=\"spells\">Spells</h3><p>A white mage casts white magic spells which are drawn from the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells-by-class/white-mage/\">white mage spell list</a>. A white mage begins play with 3 1st level white mage spells of her choice. The white mage also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Wisdom modifier to add to her list of spells. Each time a character attains a new white mage level, she gains two spells of her choice to add to her list of spells. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast. Like most mages, a white mage can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to her repertoire.</p><p>To learn or cast a spell, the white mage must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a white mage’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the white mage’s Wisdom modifier. In addition, a white mage gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Wisdom—see <strong>Table: Bonus MP per Day (by Spell Level)</strong> on the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/mp-system/\">MP System page</a>).</p><h3 id=\"white-magery\">White Magery (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level and every four white mage levels thereafter, a white mage increases her power with her spells of 1st level or higher. This ability applies only to spells that she casts as a white mage, not to those she might have by virtue of levels in another class. At each such opportunity, she can choose from the list of the following (with a maximum of 2 per):</p><ul><li><em>Healing Mastery:</em> This increases the white mage’s caster level by 1 for all spells from the healing school.</li><li><em>Increased Healing:</em> This increases any healing spell the white mage casts by 1 extra die of the appropriate type. This allows the white mage to overcome any healing cap a spell might restrict her to.</li><li><em>Spell Mastery:</em> This increases the DC for all of the white mage’s spells by 1.</li><li><em>Spell Penetration:</em> This increases the white mage’s caster level checks by 1 made to overcome a creature’s spell resistance. This stacks with the Spell Penetration feat.</li></ul><h3 id=\"spell-proficiency\">Spell Proficiency (Ex)</h3><p>White mages are considered to have the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat/\">Precise Shot</a> feat while casting spells, using class features that require ranged touch or using any magical items that require ranged touch.</p><h3 id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips</h3><p>White mages learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. White mages begin with 4 0-level spells and gain an additional 0-level spell every three levels after 1st level.</p><h3 id=\"lay-on-hands\">Lay on Hands (Su)</h3><p>At 2nd level, a white mage can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to half her white mage level plus her Wisdom modifier. With one use of this ability, a white mage can heal 1d6 hit points of damage plus an additional 1d6 for every two white mage levels after 2nd. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the white mage targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a white mage only needs one free hand to use this ability. Alternatively, a white mage can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of holy damage + 1d6 for every two levels the white mage possesses after 2nd. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.</p><h3 id=\"mage-talents\">Mage Talents (Ex or Su)</h3><p>As a white mage gains experience, she learns a number of talents that assist her in manipulating spells and other forms of magic. At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a white mage gains one mage talent. A white mage cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a white mage’s spellcasting ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual spell and the decision must be made before the spell is cast.</p><ul><li>A complete list of white mage talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/white-mage/mage-talents/\">Mage Talents</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"divine-caress\">Divine Caress (Su)</h3><p>At 3rd level, any white magic spells that the white mage casts that cures status effects provides a bonus to saving throws against that status effect equal to the spell level of the spell for 1 round.</p><h3 id=\"focused-caster\">Focused Caster (Ex)</h3><p>Beginning at 3rd level, a white mage gains the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/status-effects/#lucky\">lucky</a> status effect on any concentration check.</p><h3 id=\"divine-seal\">Divine Seal (Ex)</h3><p>Beginning at 4th level, a white mage can increase the potency of her next healing spell as a swift action, so long as the casting time of the spell is 1 standard action or less. The next healing spell the white mage casts heals for half again as many hit points. She can use this ability once per day and every four levels thereafter, she gains an additional use. The use of this ability cannot be used with metamagic feats.</p><h3 id=\"clear-mind\">Clear Mind (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 5th level, a white mage can regain her MP quicker. The white mage must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. For example, she could be riding in the back of a carriage and benefit from this ability. The white mage does not gain this recovery if she is asleep or unconscious. The white mage regains 1 MP per hour. This increases by 1 for every five white mage levels after 5th.</p><h3 id=\"metamagic-enhancement\">Metamagic Enhancement (Su)</h3><p>A white mage is a master at manipulating magical forces. At 5th level, as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a>, she reduces the cost of any metamagic feat known by one MP less than standard. For example, a 5th level white mage casts a spell with the Empower feat for 1 extra MP cost higher than the original spell. The metamagic enhancement can only be applied to one enhancement per spell. This ability does not affect the Heighten Spell feat. At 11th level and 17th level, the adjusted MP cost is reduced one additional MP. The adjusted enhancement can never reduce the base spell below its original level. A white mage may use this ability up to 3 times per day.</p><h3 id=\"arcane-defense\">Arcane Defense (Su)</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, the white mage gains the ability to form a spell shield around himself, protecting him from harmful effects. Once per day, as an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#immediate\">immediate action</a>, the white mage may gain spell resistance equal to 10 + his caster level, lasting for 1 round. The white mage may use this ability an additional time per day at 12th and 18th level.</p><h3 id=\"auto-regen\">Auto-Regen (Su)</h3><p>At 7th level, the white mage begins regenerating hit points. The white mage gains Fast Healing 2 up to 50% health, gaining the Regen status effect that cannot be dispelled. At 14th level, the white mage’s Fast Healing increases to 4.</p><h3 id=\"new-arcana\">New Arcana (Ex)</h3><p>At 7th level, the white mage can add any one spell from the white mage spell list to her list of spells known. This spell must be of a level that she is capable of casting. She can also add one additional spell at 12th level and 17th level.</p><h3 id=\"school-power\">School Power (Ex)</h3><p>At 9th level, the white mage gains <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-focus/\">Spell Focus</a> or <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/general-feats/light-focus\">Light Focus</a> as a bonus feat. If the white mage already has <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-focus/\">Spell Focus</a> in a particular school of magic or <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/general-feats/light-focus\">Light Focus</a>, she can gain <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/greater-spell-focus\">Greater Spell Focus</a> for the same school or <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/general-feats/greater-light-focus\">Greater Light Focus</a> as a bonus feat instead. If the white mage has both <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-focus/\">Spell Focus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/greater-spell-focus\">Greater Spell Focus</a> in a spell school or <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/general-feats/light-focus\">Light Focus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/general-feats/greater-light-focus\">Greater Light Focus</a>, she can select it again with this feature to increase the bonus by +1 (+3 total).</p><h3 id=\"doublecast\">Doublecast (Su)</h3><p>At 10th level, a white mage can cast two spells using one standard action. Both of the spells must have the same standard action casting time. The white mage can make any decisions concerning the spells independently of each other. A white mage receives a +4 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance with these two spells. The white mage may use this ability once per day at 10th level and one additional time per day at 15th and 20th level.</p><h3 id=\"divine-veil\">Divine Veil (Su)</h3><p>At 11th level, when a white mage uses Divine Seal, her next healing spell not only heals for double, but also removes 1 negative status effect chosen by the white mage. The use of this ability cannot be used with metamagic feats.</p><h3 id=\"advanced-mage-talents\">Advanced Mage Talents (Ex or Su)</h3><p>At 12th, and every two levels thereafter, a white mage learns further talents to assist her in manipulating spells and other forms of magic. She may choose one of the following advanced mage talents in place of a mage talent. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a white mage’s spellcasting ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual spell and the decision must be made before the spell is cast.</p><ul><li>A complete list of advanced white mage talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/white-mage/mage-talents/#advanced-mage-talents\">Advanced Mage Talents</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"metamagic-flexibility\">Metamagic Flexibility (Ex)</h3><p>At 13th level, the white mage attains flexibility in metamagic knowledge. Once per day, as part of their meditation to regain lost MP, the white mage may gain the benefit of one metamagic feat that he doesn’t possess. The white mage must meet the prerequisites of the metamagic feat.</p><p>At 16th, once per day, the white mage is able to spend a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#full-round\">full-round action</a> to change the metamagic feat they selected at the beginning of the day for a different one. At 19th, they may exchange the metamagic feat twice per day.</p><h3 id=\"sudden-metamagic\">Sudden Metamagic (Su)</h3><p>At 15th level, the white mage may apply any single metamagic feat that she knows to a 6th-level spell or lower that she is about to cast. This does not alter the level of the spell or the MP cost. The white mage can apply a metamagic feat in this way a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p><h3 id=\"bypass-spell-resistance\">Bypass Spell Resistance (Ex)</h3><p>At 17th level, the white mage’s command of magic is such that she may unravel a creature’s natural resistance to magic. A white mage may reduce a target’s spell resistance by her white mage level, once per day per target. In addition, a white mage ignores energy resistance equal to half her caster level.</p><h3 id=\"1-mp-spell\">1 MP Spell (Su)</h3><p>At 18th level, three times per day, as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>, a white mage can reduce the cost of her next spell to 1 MP. This MP reduction is applied after any metamagic cost increases. Additional metamagic cannot be applied after this cost reduction.</p><h3 id=\"shaped-area\">Shaped Area (Su)</h3><p>At 19th level, a white mage can alter areas of effect for spells that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, cylinder, emanation, or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the spell’s area or effect that are not subject to the spell. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5 ft. cube. Furthermore, any shapeable spells have a minimum dimension of 5 ft. instead of 10 ft. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p><h3 id=\"white-wizard\">White Wizard (Su)</h3><p>At 20th level, a white mage becomes the pinnacle of white magic. The white mage gains the following abilities:</p><ul><li>Any healing spells cast grants temporary hit points to the person or persons cast upon equal to 2 per spell level of the spell that last for one minute. This does not stack with any spell that grants temporary hit points, but will overwrite any such spell, even itself.</li><li>Any light spells cast gains a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#TOC-Sacred-Bonus\">Sacred Bonus</a> to damage rolls equal to the white mage’s Wisdom modifier.</li><li>Any attacks (including magical ranged touch spells) now deal an additional 1d6 points of holy damage and grants a +5 bonus to attack rolls against any creature that the white mage misses on her next attack roll.</li></ul><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have white mage as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/aegyl/\"><strong>Aegyl</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add a +1/2 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks relating to the Plane of Air and creatures with the air subtype.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/au-ra/\"><strong>Au Ra</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add one spell known from the white mage spell list.

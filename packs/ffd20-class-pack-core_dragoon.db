id=\"weapon-and-armor-proficiency\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3><p>A dragoon is proficient with simple weapons, as well as all weapons from the polearm weapon group. They are also proficient with all armor (light, medium, and heavy) but not with any shields.</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the dragoon receives the Limit Breaks (Bahamut Leaps and Bahamut Scales).</p><p><em>Bahamut Leaps (</em><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#supernatural\"><em>Su</em></a><em>):</em> This Limit Break allows the dragoon to jump further than ever before. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four dragoon levels after 1st, the dragoon can jump farther than his speed allows, doubles his bonus to Acrobatics when jumping, and mitigates all falling damage. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><p><em>Bahamut Scales (</em><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#supernatural\"><em>Su</em></a><em>):</em> This Limit Break causes the dragoon to grow magic dragon scales from his body, shielding him from harm. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four dragoon levels after 1st, the dragoon gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, increasing by an additional +1 for every two levels the dragoon possesses after 1st. Additionally, he gains an amount of temporary hit points equal to twice his dragoon level. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><h3 id=\"deadly-lancer\">Deadly Lancer (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, a dragoon has learned the technique of utilizing the impact of his jump attacks to devastate his enemies. This can manifest as either a long jump, a high jump, or a dive attack.</p><p><em>Long Jump:</em> After traveling at least 10 feet utilizing a long jump (whether as part of a charge attack, or move action), the dragoon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on his attack, increasing by an additional 1d6 for every 2 dragoon levels after 1st. This additional damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or any class feature that multiplies damage.</p><p><em>High Jump:</em> The dragoon can perform a high jump as part of a charge or <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a>, and for every 10 feet of altitude achieved with his high jump, the dragoon may move 5 feet horizontally from his starting location (simulating a diagonal high jump) to directly attack a target of equivalent altitude or lower (factoring in reach). Treat direct attacks with a high jump as a long jump for the purposes of calculating Deadly Lancer damage.</p><p><em>Dive:</em> While airborne (from a high jump or flying), the dragoon can perform a dive attack against a target of lower altitude as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#full-round\">full-round action</a>. A high jump is normally considered part of a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a>, but can also be used as part of the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#full-round\">full-round action</a> to perform a dive attack.</p><p>For every 10 feet of altitude the dragoon possesses, his dive attack gains 5 feet of horizontal range originating from his location whereby he may select a target within. Upon selecting a target, the dragoon dives his target and makes an attack (this cannot be a combat maneuver), receiving a +1 circumstance attack bonus for every 10 feet of altitude difference between him and the target. If the attack hits, the dragoon deals normal damage + long jump Deadly Lancer damage + an additional 1d6 of damage for every 10 feet of altitude difference. The bonus damage dice and attack bonus derived from the altitude difference is capped by the dragoon’s level (ex: a 5th level dragoon cannot exceed a +5 attack bonus and 5d6 points of extra damage from altitude differences), and is not multiplied on a critical hit or any class feature that multiplies damage.</p><p>After a successful dive attack, the dragoon lands into an open square within 10 feet of his target, with the altitude difference being subtracted from the dragoon’s starting altitude for the purposes of calculating falling damage.</p><p>If the dive attack misses, the dragoon lands in the nearest eligible square as if he charged on foot and takes falling damage.</p><p>Any movement that is part of a dive attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Any distance traveled that is part of a dive attack does not contribute to the dragoon’s maximum jump distance.</p><h3 id=\"jump\">Jump (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, a dragoon trains for years in the ability to leap astounding and even supernatural distances. The dragoon adds his dragoon levels to all Acrobatic skill checks for jumping. A dragoon’s ability to jump with his Acrobatic checks is treated as though he got a running start and has the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/run/\">Run</a> feat, regardless of whether or not he gets a running start. The dragoon may long jump as part of a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a> or charge action, allowing him to ignore difficult terrain for the distance he jumps. The dragoon uses his jump’s Acrobatics check to resolve against all opponents CMD while long jumping or high jumping through threatened squares, but takes the +10 to DC for moving at full speed while doing so.</p><p>A dragoon’s maximum jump distance is 2x his base speed, as if charging, instead of being <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/SKILLS/acrobatics/#Jumping_and_Falling\">limited by his normal base speed</a> (30-foot land speed = 60-foot jump maximum). Starting at 3rd level and for every 3rd level thereafter, the dragoon further increases his maximum jump distance by an additional 10 feet.</p><p>Should the dragoon utilize any of his base speed for movement on his turn, subtract that distance from his maximum jump distance to determine the distance he has left to jump.</p><h3 id=\"pole-fighting\">Pole Fighting (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, a dragoon can shorten the grip on his spear, lance, or polearm with reach and use it against adjacent targets as an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#immediate\">immediate action</a>. While under this effect, this removes the reach special feature from the weapon. The dragoon can spend another <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#immediate\">immediate action</a> to return to the normal grip.</p><h3 id=\"strengthened-agility\">Strengthened Agility (Ex)</h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, a dragoon adds his Strength modifier as a bonus (minimum 0) on any <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics/\">Acrobatics</a> skill checks made to <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/Acrobatics/#Jumping_and_Falling\">jump</a>.</p><h3 id=\"dragoon-talents\">Dragoon Talents (Ex or Su)</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, a dragoon gains a dragoon talent. He gains an additional one for every 2 dragoon levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a dragoon cannot select an individual dragoon talent more than once.</p><ul><li>A complete list of dragoon talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/dragoon/dragoon-talents/\">Dragoon Talents</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"hardy-landing\">Hardy Landing (Ex)</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, a dragoon becomes skilled at mitigating falling damage. When first gaining this ability, the dragoon takes damage as if the fall were 10 feet shorter than it actually is (this effect stacks with the Acrobatics skill check (DC 15) to ignore the first 10 feet of a fall). Additionally, the dragoon treats all damage from falling as nonlethal. The dragoon’s ability to absorb his fall improves with his dragoon level, allowing him another 10 feet every two levels after 2nd, until at 20th level he can fall any distance without harm.</p><h3 id=\"super-jump\">Super Jump (Ex)</h3><p>At 2nd level, the dragoon can empower his jump to send him soaring, emulating the ability to fly. By activating this ability at the start of his jump as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>, the dragoon lowers the Acrobatics high jump DC multiplier from 4 to 1 for that jump (ex: a high jump of 20 feet would be lowered from an Acrobatics DC of 80 to an Acrobatics DC of 20). Additionally, the dragoon receives a +10 bonus to Acrobatics for that jump. The dragoon suffers no falling damage for the vertical distance he high jumps when using this ability.</p><p>The dragoon can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his dragoon level, and no more than once per round.</p><h3 id=\"armor-training\">Armor Training (Ex)</h3><p>At 3rd level, a dragoon learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –5 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +5 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p><p>In addition, a dragoon can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a dragoon can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p><h3 id=\"blood-of-the-dragon\">Blood of the Dragon (Ex)</h3><p>At 3rd level, dragon’s blood has coalesced with the dragoon’s own, enabling him to achieve supernatural feats of power. The number of dragon blood points in the dragoon’s blood is equal to half his dragoon level + his Constitution modifier. Dragon blood points are replenished once per day when the dragoon rests for a full 8 hours. Additionally, the dragoon may perform the Lancet ability. The dragoon unlocks additional Blood of the Dragon abilities as he levels up.</p><p><em>Lancet (Ex)</em>: At 3rd level, by spending 1 point of dragon blood as a swift action, the dragoon can empower his next melee attack with a polearm or spear that inflicts piercing damage to drain the life force from a living foe. The dragoon receives a +2 circumstance bonus to this attack and heals himself of 2d6 damage, with the attack bonus and amount of healing dice increasing by 1 for every two levels after 3rd. This effect lasts until the end of the dragoon’s turn or until expended by a successful attack.</p><p><em>Dragon’s Breath (Su)</em>: At 5th level, the dragoon picks an element – he may select earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind. Once the dragoon makes this choice, he cannot change it later. By spending 1 point of dragon blood as a standard action, the dragoon may breath either a 15 foot cone or line that deals 1d6 points of the chosen element in damage per dragoon level. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the dragoon’s level + his Constitution modifier) halves the damage.</p><p><em>Tail Sweep (Ex)</em>: At 8th level, by spending 1 point of dragon blood as a standard action, the dragoon can make a trip combat maneuver with his polearm or spear against creatures within an area that he threatens. The affected area must consist of at least three contiguous squares. Additionally, the dragoon receives a bonus to this combat maneuver check equal to half his dragoon level. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and does not cause the dragoon to fall prone should he fail his check by 10 or more.</p><p><em>Dragon Sight (Su)</em>: At 11th level, by spending 1 point of dragon blood as a swift action, the dragoon can utilize his dragon blood to greatly enhance his perceptive abilities for 1 minute. While in effect, the dragoon’s irises glow a fiery crimson, with him being able to see through normal and magical darkness, see the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, and see invisible creatures or objects normally for up to 120 feet. Additionally, the dragoon gains a Perception bonus equal to his level. The dragoon may extend the duration of this ability as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a> by spending an additional point of dragon blood.</p><p><em>Stardiver (Su)</em>: At 17th level, by spending 1 point of dragon blood as part of his dive attack action, the dragoon can cause his dive attack to erupt in a cataclysm of flames, incinerating creatures near his target. Upon a successful dive attack hit, the dragoon inflicts fire damage equal to his dive attack’s Deadly Lancer damage to all creatures (excluding the target of the dive attack and the dragoon themselves) within 5 feet of his target. The dragoon may choose to widen the explosion’s radius to his liking; it may grow by an additional 5 feet for every 10 feet of altitude difference. Creatures within this radius are allowed a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the dragoon’s level + his Constitution modifier) to halve the damage. The dragoon is unable to utilize Stardiver as part of a Multi-Jump.</p><h3 id=\"elusive-jump\">Elusive Jump (Ex)</h3><p>At 4th level, whenever the dragoon would be presented with certain types of danger, he may long jump to an open square up to 15 feet away as an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#immediate\">immediate action</a> without provoking attacks of opportunity. This ability confers different benefits depending on the type of scenario:</p><ul><li>Should the dragoon be targeted by an attack, he gains a +3 dodge bonus to AC against that attack and any further attacks made against him in that action, with the long jump executing after all attacks are resolved by his foe.</li><li>If the dragoon is the target of an ability or spell with an area of effect that has a Reflex save component, the dragoon may long jump away in response. This confers a +3 bonus to any Reflex saves imposed by that ability or spell should he land outside the area of effect.</li></ul><p>At 9th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by an additional +1 .</p><p>The dragoon must declare usage of this ability after his foe declares their intent, but before any rolls are made.</p><p>The dragoon may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Constitution modifier.</p><h3 id=\"polearm-training\">Polearm Training (Ex)</h3><p>At 5th level a dragoon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with spears, lances, and polearms. This bonus increases by +1 for every five levels beyond 5th.</p><h3 id=\"wyrmkiller\">Wyrmkiller (Ex)</h3><p>At 6th level a dragoon becomes an expert in dragon lore and fighting dragons. He may attempt Knowledge: Arcana skill checks untrained when dealing with dragons or creatures of the dragon subtype. The dragoon also receives a bonus to Knowledge: Arcana skill checks equal to his dragoon level when dealing with dragons or creatures with the dragon subtype.</p><p>Additionally, the dragoon maximizes all Deadly Lancer damage dice versus dragons or creatures with the dragon subtype.</p><h3 id=\"swoop-of-the-dragon\">Swoop of the Dragon (Ex)</h3><p>At 7th level, a dragoon’s charge is akin to the ferocious swoop of a dragon. When long jumping as part of a charge action, the dragoon receives a +4 attack bonus with a spear or polearm (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the dragoon takes no penalty to his AC with this action (normally a -2 penalty to AC for 1 round).</p><h3 id=\"wall-jumping\">Wall Jumping (Ex)</h3><p>At 9th level, a dragoon may select a square with a wall as his target for a long jump as part of a charge or <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a> (see Jump class feature). If he arrives at the targeted square he may pivot and make another Acrobatics check with a +10 bonus to long jump and continue that charge or <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a> and travel in a line that is non-parallel to that wall. A dragoon can utilize this class feature multiple times in the same turn, with the bonus to Acrobatics degrading by 5 for every wall jump after the first (this can turn into a penalty), but still cannot exceed his maximum allowable jump distance.</p><h3 id=\"ride-the-wind\">Ride the Wind (Ex)</h3><p>At 10th level, a dragoon adds an additional Deadly Lancer damage die on the first 10 foot increment of altitude difference with his dive attack (ex: a dive attack with an altitude difference of 20 feet would add 2d6 Deadly Lancer damage for the first 10 feet and 1d6 for the 10 feet after, resulting in 3d6 bonus Deadly Lancer damage). At 13th level and every 3rd level thereafter, the dragoon’s next 10 foot increment gains an additional Deadly Lancer die.</p><h3 id=\"spinning-lance\">Spinning Lance (Ex)</h3><p>At 12th level, a dragoon gains the ability to spin his lance, allowing him to deflect incoming attacks. Immediately after his attack or full-attack action, the dragoon gains a shield bonus to his AC equal to the number of successful attacks he made with his polearm or spear in that round. If the dragoon is wearing a shield, the shield bonus to AC stacks, but he only gains half the benefit (minimum +1). This effect lasts for 1 round, but may be extended by an additional round if he utilizes a total defense action in the round thereafter. The dragoon does not retain this bonus if he is rendered helpless or is knocked prone.</p><h3 id=\"multi-jump\">Multi-Jump (Ex)</h3><p>At 13th level, a dragoon learns to use the momentum of his dive attacks to chain additional high jumps. Upon delivering a successful dive attack, instead of landing, the dragoon may activate his Super Jump ability (thus expending an additional daily usage of this ability) to attempt another high jump into a dive attack at a -20 Acrobatics penalty (this penalty stacks with additional uses of this ability). The dragoon cannot dive attack a target more than once using this ability.</p><h3 id=\"flawless-lancer\">Flawless Lancer (Ex)</h3><p>At 15th level, a dragoon doesn’t automatically miss when he rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll while utilizing his Deadly Lancer class feature.</p><h3 id=\"piercing-critical\">Piercing Critical (Ex)</h3><p>At 19th level, a dragoon increases his critical threat range by 1 while using a polearm or spear. This amount increases to 2 for attacks that would utilize his Deadly Lancer class feature. These increases are applied after any effects that multiply the critical threat range of a weapon (ex: the Improved Critical feat).</p><h3 id=\"master-dragoon\">Master Dragoon (Ex)</h3><p>At 20th level, the dragoon deals double weapon damage for attacks that utilize his Deadly Lancer class feature. This is not the same as a critical hit. In addition, if the dragoon confirms a critical hit on an attack that utilizes his Deadly Lancer class feature, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Fortitude save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + the number of Deadly Lancer dice inflicted.</p><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have dragoon as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class

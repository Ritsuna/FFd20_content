Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.</em></p><p><strong>Role:</strong> More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies’ prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> A cleric’s alignment must be within one step of her deity’s, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.</p><p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8</p><p><strong>Starting Wealth:</strong> 4d6 × 10 gil (average 140 gil.)

also proficient with the favored weapon of their deities.</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the cleric receives Limit Breaks based on his deity.</p><h3 id=\"spellcasting\">Spellcasting</h3><p>A cleric casts spells which are drawn from the spell list that their deific order specifies. Additionally, the cleric uses his Wisdom modifier in place of whatever casting modifier the spell drawn from this spell list specifies.</p><p>Beginning at 1st level, he gains access to the following spells: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-chaos/\">Detect Chaos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-evil/\">Detect Evil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-good/\">Detect Good</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-law/\">Detect Law</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/protection-from-evil/\">Protection from Evil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/protection-from-good/\">Protection from Good</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/protection-from-law/\">Protection from Law</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/protection-from-chaos/\">Protection from Chaos</a>.</p><p>At 4th level, a cleric gains access to the following spells: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/protection-from-evil-communal/\">Communal Protection from Evil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/protection-from-good-communal/\">Communal Protection from Good</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/protection-from-law-communal/\">Communal Protection from Law</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/protection-from-chaos-communal/\">Communal Protection from Chaos</a>.</p><p>At 7th level, a cleric gains access to the following spells: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/m/magic-circle-against-evil\">Magic Circle against Evil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/m/magic-circle-against-good/\">Magic Circle against Good</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/m/magic-circle-against-law/\">Magic Circle against Law</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/m/magic-circle-against-chaos/\">Magic Circle against Chaos</a>.</p><p>At 10th level, a cleric gains access to the following spells: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/c/chaos-hammer/\">Chaos Hammer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/h/holy-smite\">Holy Smite</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/o/orders-wrath/\">Order’s Wrath</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/u/unholy-blight/\">Unholy Blight</a>.</p><p>At 13th level, a cleric gains access to the following spells: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/a/atonement/\">Atonement</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/dispel-evil/\">Dispel Evil</a>,<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/dispel-good/\"> Dispel Good</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/dispel-law/\">Dispel Law</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/dispel-chaos/\">Dispel Chaos</a>.</p><p>At 16th level, a cleric gains access to the following spells: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/s/shield-of-evil/\">Shield of Evil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/s/shield-of-good/\">Shield of Good</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/s/shield-of-law/\">Shield of Law</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/s/shield-of-chaos/\">Shield of Chaos</a>.</p><p>These spells are in addition to his normal spell list. However, for the alignment spells, the cleric must be of the same alignment to cast them. A neutral cleric can decide which at 1st level (good or evil, chaos or law).</p><h3 id=\"spell-proficiency\">Spell Proficiency (Ex)</h3><p>Clerics are considered to have the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat/\">Precise Shot</a> feat while casting spells, using class features that require ranged touch or using any magical items that require ranged touch.</p><h3 id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips</h3><p>Clerics learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, based on their deity. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. Clerics begin with 2 0-level spells and gain an additional 0-level spell every three levels after 1st level.</p><h3 id=\"deific-order\">Deific Order (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, a cleric must worship a specific deity. The deity grants the cleric a number of special abilities and <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/cleric/domains/\">domains</a>. A cleric cannot change his deity without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new deity. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old deity.</p><ul><li>A complete list of deific orders can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/cleric/deific-orders/\">Deific Orders</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"deity-abilities\">Deity Abilities</h3><p class=\"western\">A cleric gains deity abilities from his deific order as he increases in level.’</p><h3 id=\"faith\">Faith (Su)</h3><p>A cleric’s power is drawn from his faith, a deep and powerful belief in a deity. At 1st level, the cleric’s faith manifests itself in a pool of points which fuel his powers. The cleric’s faith pool is equal to half his cleric level plus his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). When casting a spell, he can expend 1 point of faith to increase his effective caster level by 1 or increase the DC of the spell by 1. The cleric regains all expended faith when he regains MP each day.</p><h3 id=\"sense-alignment\">Sense Alignment (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, at will, a cleric can, as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a>, concentrate on a single item or individual within 30 feet and determine what the alignment is, with a successful Sense Motive skill check. The DC for an item is equal to 10 + the caster level of the item. The DC for an individual is equal to 10 + the CR of the creature.</p><h3 id=\"channel-energy\">Channel Energy (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.</p><p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) channels light energy and can choose to deal holy damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) channels dark energy and can choose to deal shadow damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether he channels light or dark energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed.</p><p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage (holy or shadow) dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + half of the cleric’s level + his Charisma modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or not to include himself in this effect. A cleric must be able to present his holy symbol to use this ability.</p><h3 id=\"faith-talents\">Faith Talents (Ex/Su)</h3><p>As a cleric gains experience, he learns a number of talents that assist him in manipulating spells and maintaining faith. At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, a cleric gains one faith talent. A cleric cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a cleric’s spellcasting ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual spell and the decision must be made before the spell is cast.</p><ul><li>A complete list of faith talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/cleric/faith-talents/\">Faith Talents</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"armored-mage\">Armored Mage (Ex)</h3><p>At 2nd level, normally, armor of any kind interferes with a spell-caster’s gestures, which can cause spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A cleric’s limited focus and specialized training, however, allows him to avoid spell failure so long as he sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium armor or to heavy shields. This ability does not apply to spells gained from a different spell-casting class. At 9th level, a cleric learns to use medium armor with no chance of spell failure. At 13th level, a cleric learns to use heavy shields with no chance of spell failure.</p><h3 id=\"blessing-of-the-faithful\">Blessing of the Faithful (Su)</h3><p>At 4th level, as a swift action, the cleric can bless one ally within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). A blessed ally gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus (depending on whether the cleric channels positive or negative energy) on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, or saving throws or to AC until the cleric’s next turn. The cleric can expend 1 use of channel energy when activating this ability to increase the duration to a number of rounds equal to the number of dice of his channel energy.</p><h3 id=\"clear-mind\">Clear Mind (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 5th level, a cleric can regain his MP quicker. The cleric must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. For example, he could be riding in the back of a carriage and benefit from this ability. The cleric does not gain this recovery if he is asleep or unconscious. The cleric regains 1 MP per hour. This increases by 1 for every five cleric levels after 5th.</p><h3 id=\"prayer\">Prayer (Su)</h3><p>At 7th level, by spending 1 minute praying a cleric can spend one use of channel energy to give living or undead creatures in the channel burst temporary hit points equal to the amount that ability normally heals. These temporary hit points last for no more than 1 hour.</p><h3 id=\"extra-domain\">Extra Domain (Su)</h3><p>At 8th level, a cleric gains another domain from his deity’s domain list. Granted powers from the cleric’s extra domain function as if the cleric’s level, Wisdom, and Charisma were 3 lower than normal in terms of effect, DC, and uses per day. This also means the cleric doesn’t gain the domain’s higher-level ability until three cleric levels later than normal.</p><h3 id=\"deitys-intuition\">Deity’s Intuition (Ex)</h3><p>At 11th level, a cleric knows how to take best advantage of tactical opportunities. Whenever he is flanking or makes an attack of opportunity, he may add his Charisma bonus (if any) as a bonus on the attack roll. In addition, once per day as a swift action, he may add his Charisma modifier as a bonus on any single d20 roll made as part of a readied action. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every three cleric levels after 11th.</p><h3 id=\"advanced-faith-talents\">Advanced Faith Talents (Ex/Su)</h3><p>At 12th, and every two levels thereafter, a cleric learns further talents to assist him in manipulating spells and maintaining faith. He may choose one of the following advanced faith talents in place of a faith talent. Talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a cleric’s spellcasting ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual spell and the decision must be made before the spell is cast.</p><ul><li>A complete list of advanced faith talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/cleric/faith-talents/\">Advanced Faith Talents</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"devotion\">Devotion (Su)</h3><p>At 14th level, a cleric can apply the Silent Spell and Still Spell feats to a spell he is about to cast. This does not alter the MP cost. He can use this ability once per day at 14th level and one additional time per day for every two cleric levels beyond 14th. Even though this ability does not modify the spell’s MP cost, he cannot use this ability to cast a spell whose modified spell level would be above the level of the highest-level spell that he is capable of casting. This ability always applies both feats (the cleric cannot use it to just apply one or the other).</p><h3 id=\"legions-blessing\">Legion’s Blessing (Su)</h3><p>At 16th level, a cleric gains the ability to confer beneficial magic to a large group of allies surrounding the cleric. As a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#full-round\">full-round action</a>, the cleric may confer the effects of a single-targeted spell or song to all allies within 10 feet of the cleric. The spell or song must have a cast time of standard or less, must be harmless enhancing, and must not have a range of Personal. Using Legion’s Blessing expends the MP of the spell, and an additional 3 MP without increasing the spell level. Metamagic may be added as normal. The cleric can use this ability a number of times equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. If Legion’s Blessing is used with a Song, its effects reapply at the start of every round to its initial targets as long as they are within the song’s range.</p><h3 id=\"true-channeler\">True Channeler (Su)</h3><p>At 17th level, when a cleric channels energy, he can choose to reroll any 1s or 2s when determining how much damage he heals or damages with the energy.</p><h3 id=\"aspect-of-the-deity\">Aspect of the Deity (Su)</h3><p>At 19th level, the cleric can channel an aspect of his deity, growing in power and martial ability.

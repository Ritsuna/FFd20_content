They gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, and &ndash;2 Constitution.</li>\n<li>Type: Humanoid Plant: Mandragoras are unique creatures, possessing traits of both humanoids and plants. A mandragora is treated as both humanoid and plant for the purposes of effects that target a specific type of creature. Unlike most plants, a mandragora is not immune to mind-<wbr />affecting effects, poison, paralysis, polymorph, or stunning.</li>\n<li>Size: Mandragoras are Small creatures and thus gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a &ndash;1 penalty to their Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.</li>\n<li>Base Speed: Mandragoras have a base speed of 20 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages: Mandragoras begin play speaking Common and Mandragoran. Mandragoras with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Draconic, Dwarven, Elvaan, Galkan, Giant, Goblin, and Sylvan. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Elemental Resistance: With such an attachment to the earth, mandragoras don&rsquo;t take as much damage from it. Mandragoras gain resistance 5 against earth damage.</li>\n<li>Hydrated Vitality: Mandragoras gain fast healing 2 for 1 round anytime they submerge completely within a body of natural salt water, fresh water, or brackish water. Stagnant, poisoned, or trapped water (such as water within an artificial pit or a bag of holding) does not activate this ability. Mandragoras can heal up to 2 hit points per level per day with this ability, after which it ceases to function.</li>\n<li>Natural Armor: Their plant-<wbr />like nature has gifted mandragoras with a fibrous, stiff skin much like bark. This grants them a +1 natural armor bonus.</li>\n<li>Plant Resistance: While technically a plant, a mandragora has more in common with most humanoids. They gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-<wbr />affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), paralysis, poison, and polymorph effects. They are immune to sleep effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Camouflage: Mandragoras gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks while in marshes or forested terrains.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Magical Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In Tune with the Earth: Mandragoras are treated as 1 level higher when casting spells with the earth descriptor. This ability does not give mandragoras early access to level-<wbr />based powers; it only affects powers that they could already use without this ability.</li>\n<li>Spell-<wbr />Like Ability (Su): Mandragoras can use <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/photosynthesis\">photosynthesis</a> once per day as a spell-<wbr />like ability (caster level equal to the mandragora&rsquo;s class level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Movement Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Terrain Stride: Mandragoras ignore natural difficult terrain within forests and move at their normal speed within said environments. Magically altered terrain affects them normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Shriek: Once per day as a standard action, a mandragora can give voice to an unsettling shriek. All creatures within a 30-<wbr />foot spread of a shrieking mandragora must make a Will save (DC 10 + half of the mandragora&rsquo;s character level + its Wisdom modifier) or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-<wbr />affecting ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bioluminescence: At will, a mandragora can cause any part of his body to glow, giving off light as a torch.</li>\n<li>Sunlight Sustenance: A mandragora does not eat food, but must consume water like all living things. As long as it receives at least six hours of sunlight per day, a mandragora requires only 1/4th the water a normal humanoid would. A mandragora deprived of adequate sunlight for more than two days at a time becomes fatigued until it gets at least six hours of sunlight. If it does not get sunlight for more than a week, it becomes exhausted until it gets at least six hours of sunlight. A one hour exposure to a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/daylight\">daylight</a> spell will fulfill a mandragora&rsquo;s daily needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision: Mandragoras can see twice as far as humes in conditions of dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Temperature Vulnerability: A mandragora has trouble regulating its body temperature. Mandragoras have a &ndash;<wbr />4 penalty to Fortitude saves made against environmental effects.</li>\n<li>Vulnerable to Fire: Mandragoras take 150% as much damage as normal from fire attacks, unless they are immune to fire via other special defenses.</li>\n<li>Weakened by Cold: As the winter slows the growth of trees, it also tires and weakens the mandragora. If a mandragora suffers ice damage, it withers and wilts, needing to make a Fortitude save equal to 10 + the half the damage suffered. Failure to save means the mandragora is staggered for 1 round.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buoyant: Mandragoras with this racial trait lived by the water. They gain a +4 competence bonus to Swim checks and a 20-foot swim speed. This racial trait replaces camouflage and in tune with the earth.</li>\n<li>Burned One: You survived a forest fire or being struck by lightning. You gain your choice of fire or lightning resistance 5. Once chosen, this choice cannot be changed. This racial trait replaces plant resistance and vulnerable to fire.</li>\n<li>Cactuar Kin: Your clan&rsquo;s ancestors were desert-<wbr />dwelling cactuars. The whole of your body is covered with small spines. When you are struck with a natural weapon or unarmed strike, your opponent suffers 1d3 points of piercing damage. You also deal this damage to your opponent each round while grappling. This racial trait replaces plant resistance.</li>\n<li>Dark Root: Your lineage is more closely related to tubers and other root plants than to soaring sequoia or grand oaks. You gain darkvision 60 feet and a burrow speed of 15 feet. This racial trait replaces low-<wbr />light vision and bioluminescence.</li>\n<li>Evergreen: You grew up in harsh climates, where the winds were harsh and the cold biting, but that only served to numb those pains. You gain your choice of ice or wind resistance 5. Once chosen, this choice cannot be changed. This racial trait replaces plant resistance and weakened by cold.</li>\n<li>Malboro Kin: Your clan&rsquo;s ancestors were the poison-spewing Malboro. You have Water Resistance 5, and you exude a powerful stench, causing creatures who share a square with you, have swallowed you whole or creatures with Scent who are within 10 feet, must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the Mandragora&rsquo;s character level + its Constitution modifier) or become Sickened for 1 round. Creatures who make the save become immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a Poison effect. This racial trait replaces elemental resistance and plant resistance.</li>\n<li>Pestilent: Your lineage began in a stagnant swamp. You gain immunity against poison and disease. This racial trait replaces plant resistance.</li>\n<li>Photosynthetic Regrowth: A mandragora with this racial trait recovers lost hit points every hour rather than every day as long as it remains in direct sunlight for the entire hour. This racial trait replaces natural armor.</li>\n<li>Pithy Toughness: Mandragoras with this racial trait gain <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/toughness-final/\">Toughness</a> as a bonus feat.

They gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, and  &ndash;<wbr />2 Charisma.</li>\n<li>Size: Al Bheds are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Type: Al Bheds are Humanoid creatures with the al bhed subtype.</li>\n<li>Base Speed: Al Bheds have a base speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages: Al Bheds begin play speaking Common and Albhedian. Al Bheds with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Desert Nomad: Al Bheds thrive in the deepest deserts, forever roaming across burned and parched lands. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Constitution checks and Fortitude saves to avoid fatigue, exhaustion, or ill effects from running, forced marches, starvation, thirst, or hot or cold environments.</li>\n<li>Trap Knowledge: Al Bheds know the inner mechanical workings of most traps. They gain +2 racial bonus on all saving throws versus mechanical traps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixer-<wbr />Upper: Al Bheds gain the Repair skill as a class skill regardless of class. In addition, they never take penalties for not having a toolkit while using the Repair skill. Furthermore, they only take 30 minutes to use the Repair skill to repair damage done to a construct.</li>\n<li>Mechanical Genius: At first level, Al Bheds gain an additional skill rank and a +2 racial bonus to skill rolls which they must apply to one of the following: Knowledge (engineering), Profession (engineering), Craft (any), Disable Device, or Use Magical Device. These skills are always considered class skills for an al bhed.</li>\n<li>Skill Training: Al Bheds treat Drive and Pilot as class skills.</li>\n<li>Technologist: Al Bheds are intuitive and have an innate understanding of technology, gaining <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/technology-feats/technologist/\">Technologist</a> as a bonus feat.</li>\n<li>Weapon Familiarity: Al Bheds are proficient with Simple Firearms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Academician: Some al bheds are more academically inclined than their kin. Al Bheds with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on any single Knowledge skill. This racial trait replaces technologist.</li>\n<li>Child of the Sea: Al Bheds from a coastal region with this racial trait gain a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks as well as on Profession (sailor) and Wisdom checks to pilot a sea vessel. They also have an innate sense of direction and can never get lost at sea. This racial trait replaces desert nomad.</li>\n<li>Explorer: Many al bheds are obsessed with seeing as much of the world as possible, rather than perfecting some specific talent or vocation. These al bheds gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim checks and these skills are always considered class skills. This racial trait replaces mechanical genius and desert nomad.</li>\n<li>Magic Resistant: Some al bheds are particularly resistant to magic. Al Bheds with this racial trait gain spell resistance equal to 11 + their character level. This resistance can be lowered for 1 round as a standard action. Al Bheds with this racial trait take a &ndash;2 penalty on all concentration checks made in relation to arcane spells. This racial trait replaces fixer-<wbr />upper and weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Mechanical Dismantler: Al Bheds are known for their innate ability to dismantle Mechina better than most. Al Bheds gain a +4 racial bonus on Steal maneuver checks used against Machina subtypes. This racial trait replaces skill training.</li>\n<li>Xenophobic: Isolationist al bheds despise non-<wbr />al bhed humanoids. They speak only Al Bhed and do not gain any bonus languages from possessing a high Intelligence score. In addition, they learn only one language per 2 ranks of Linguistics they possess. However, their untrusting nature gives them a +1 bonus against mind-<wbr />affecting effects, except for fear affects. This racial trait replaces an al bhed&rsquo;s normal languages.</li>\n<li>Wary: Many al bheds have spent their long lives moving from place to place, often driven out by the hostility of others. Such experiences have made them wary of others&rsquo; motivations. Al Bheds with this trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Sense Motive and Bluff checks. This racial trait replaces desert nomad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Feats</h2>\n<p>The following feats are available to an al bhed character who meets the prerequisites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/arcane-craft\">Arcane Craft</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/arcane-ruin-al-bhed\">Arcane Ruin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/booby-trap-al-bhed\">Booby Trap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/jury-rig-al-bhed\">Jury-<wbr />Rig</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/monkey-wrench-al-bhed\">Monkey Wrench</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/spring-loaded-al-bhed\">Spring Loaded</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to al bheds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/ninja/archetypes/psyche/\">Psyche</a> (Ninja; Al Bhed)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/engineer/archetypes/tinker/\">Tinker</a> (Engineer; Al Bhed)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/chemist/\">Chemist</a>: Add +1/4 to the chemist&rsquo;s damage rolls with thrown weapons.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/engineer/\">Engineer</a>: Add +1 hit point or +1 to one saving throw to the engineer&rsquo;s automaton.

Due to the nature of their creation, the majority of the Genome population lack a soul, and have little to no emotional response; Genomes are nothing more than empty husks awaiting the attainment of a soul. A Genomes existence is perpetually incomplete until they receive a soul. As such, the collective Genome existence is dedicated to the preparation of attaining a soul, mentally and physically. The Genomes also seem to know a great deal of the Soul Cycle and the world in which they live. Although this knowledge is useless to a vessel who will soon forget what they have learned upon receiving a soul, information is circulated among the population to prevent mental decay. The Genomes harbor production facilities in which they create more of their race. Through these production facilities, they aim to create a more suitable vessel for a soul to reside in. This could also be interpreted as somewhat recreational due to their seemingly meaningless existence. Genomes are normally isolated, creating villages around their production facilities. Because of this, when a Genome attains a soul, it is not uncommon for them stay with their own kind. A Genome found away from one of these villages was probably sent to procure knowledge for the creation of more perfect Genomes. Genomes typically come in two forms, Terran and Gaian. Terran Genomes often have long flexible tails, and blonde hair, while Gaian Genomes often look dark, with shadowed faces, bright yellow eyes, and a greater aptitude in magic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/genome/\">View Genome on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;

They gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, and -2 Charisma.</li>\n<li>Size: Genomes are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Type: Genomes are humanoids with the genome subtype.</li>\n<li>Base Speed: Genomes have a base speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages: Genomes begin play Common. Genomes with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reborn Spirit: Many of the souls within genomes have experienced death at least once granting them a strange resilience. Genomes gain a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against Death spells and effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sneaky: Genomes are adept at infiltrating other worlds. Genomes gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.</li>\n<li>Technological Instinct: Many genomes who awaken in a Genome village have an inherently advanced understanding of technology. Genomes gain <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/technology-feats/technologist/\">Technologist</a> as a bonus feat and always treat Knowledge (Technology) as a class skill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dexterous Tail: Genomes have a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but they can retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action.</li>\n<li>Ideal Vessel: Engineered for perfection, a genome&rsquo;s class level is considered to be 1 level higher for the purpose of determining the DC of the genome&rsquo;s class abilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Isolated: Most of a genome&rsquo;s life after &ldquo;awakening&rdquo;, is spent around soulless genomes, making it hard to learn to express any sort of emotion or empathy, taking a -2 penalty on all Diplomacy checks. A humanoid&rsquo;s starting attitude towards genomes is one step worse than normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignorant Upbringing: Genomes that &ldquo;awaken&rdquo; in civilized areas, far from any of the Genome villages, often live normal lives, exposed to a variety of people. These genomes are often ignorant how they came to be. Genomes gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat-final/\">Weapon Focus</a> feat for a weapon they are proficient with, even if they do not qualify for it. Because of their naivety, genomes with this trait also take a -2 penalty on all Sense Motive Checks. This racial trait replaces technological instinct and isolated, as well as changing the Racial Ability Scores to: +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, and -2 Wisdom.</li>\n<li>Mystic Vessel: A genome with this trait has high aptitude for magic, and considers his caster modifier +1 higher for purposes of determining bonus MP. The genome also gains a +2 racial bonus to Spellcraft and Knowledge (Arcana) skill checks. This racial trait replaces ideal vessel and dexterous tail.</li>\n<li>Resilient Soul: A genome with this trait chooses one of the following: Fortitude, Reflex, or Will. The genome gains a permanent +1 racial bonus to all saving throws of that type. This racial trait replaces reborn spirit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to genomes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/dancer/archetypes/trance-dancer/\">Trance Dancer</a> (Dancer; Genome)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/\">Archer</a>: Add +1 foot to the range increment with bows or crossbows.

They have soft, melodious voices and are disinclined to be harsh. They are known for their brightly colored and wildly styled hair, often floral or tree-like. They are a somber and astute people, inclined towards traditionalism. Guados are most known for their connections to the forces of death and their links to the afterlife, often tasking themselves with protecting places with strong ties to other realms and planes of existence, especially those where souls are confirmed to reside after their death. Guados take well to the life of the faithful, and are often found as priests in places where they are not known to commonly reside, performing embalming services, funeral rites, and other rituals associated with death. However, their association with death has a habit of making them a bit alien or unnerving to other races, and Guados, as a result, tend to form their own communities outside of the settlements of other races, rather than intermingle freely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/guado/\">View Guado on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;

They gain +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, and -2 Constitution.</li>\n<li>Size: Guados are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Type: Guados are Humanoids with the guado subtype.</li>\n<li>Base Speed: Guados have a base speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages: Guados begin play speaking Common and Guado. Guados with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following for their bonus languages: Al Bhed, Draconic, Elvaan, Lalafell, Numish, Ronsaur, or Vieran.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deathless Spirit: Guados are creatures that are attuned to the bridges between life and death, being sensitive to their ebbs and flows, yet resistant to their negative effects. Being living creatures, the forces of death and undeath have less sway over them than other mortals. They gain Shadow Resistance 5. In addition, they do not lose hit points when they gain a negative level, and they gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and spells or spell-like abilities of the necromancy or dark spell varieties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Skill Bonuses: Being associated with the powers of life and death makes one hard to read, and by extension hard to fool. This is only further exacerbated by the sometimes lyrical, poetic, or unsettling ways guados tend to speak. Guados gain a +2 racial bonus to Bluff and Sense Motive skills.</li>\n<li>Skill Training: Knowledge of the ways of life and death, bridges between the two, and the aspects of undeath are core to the beliefs and the traditions of the guado. Guados always treat Knowledge (Planes) and Knowledge (Religion) as class skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Magical Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect Undead (Sp): Once per day, a guado can cast <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-undead\">detect undead</a> as a spell-<wbr />like ability (caster level equal to the guado&rsquo;s class level).</li>\n<li>Elemental Summoner: Choose one of the following elemental subtypes&mdash;earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, wind. When summoning a creature with the chosen subtype with a summon spell, increase the duration of that spell by 2 rounds. This choice is made at character creation, and can only be changed with retraining.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Movement Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moderate Fleetness: Guados&rsquo; long limbs allow them to walk and run faster than what others expect of them, but their slender frames only make these advantages go so far. So long as a guado has no more than a medium load, and is not fatigued, exhausted, or suffering any ability damage to its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, its base land speed is increased by 5 feet. Guados who have attained a Swim speed may apply this bonus to it as well, but not to any Climb, Fly, or Burrow speeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carrion Sense: Some guados are more attuned to deathlike energies than others of their kind, having the disturbing ability to track creatures by the scent of their lifeblood. This functions like the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities/#TOC-Scent\">scent</a> ability, but only for corpses and badly wounded creatures (creatures with 25% or fewer hit points). This racial trait replaces skill training.</li>\n<li>Deep Magic: Guados tend to live underground when they can, as a means to remain undisturbed, and also as most gates to other planes of existence are found in underground locations, accessed through caves. Particularly rude or unscrupulous non-guados will often make the snide connection between this habit and the practice of burial. Guados with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance and a +2 racial bonus when dispelling magic. This racial trait replaces deathless spirit.</li>\n<li>Fast Movement: Some guados, especially those of a more athletic bend, have refined their longer stride to boost their speed even further. Guados with this racial trait increase their base land speed by 10 feet. This racial trait replaces moderate fleetness, and skill bonuses.</li>\n<li>Unsent Summoner: Guados who are so in touch with the afterlife learn more advanced techniques to control or create them. When casting spells to summon or create undead, guados treat their caster level as if it were 2 higher, this does not give them earlier access to spells. This racial trait replaces elemental summoner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to guados:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/cleric/archetypes/exorcist/\">Exorcist</a> (Cleric; Guado)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/astrologian/\">Astrologian</a>: The astrologian gains +1/6th of an astrology secret.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/black-mage/\">Black Mage</a>: The black mage gains +1/6th of a mage talent.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/cleric/\">Cleric</a>: The cleric inflicts or restores +1 damage/hit point on undead targets when using channel energy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/dark-knight/\">Dark Knight</a>: The dark knight restores +1 hit point on undead targets when using harm touch.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/holy-knight/\">Holy Knight</a>: The holy knight inflicts +1 damage to undead creatures when using lay on hands.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/illusionist/\">Illusionist</a>: The illusionist gains +1/6th of a veil power.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/necromancer/\">Necromancer</a>: The necromancer restores +1 hit point on undead targets when using harm touch.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/scholar/\">Scholar</a>: The scholar gains +1/6th of a scholar exploit.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/summoner/\">Summoner</a>: Reduce damage dealt to summoner as a result of life link by 1.

Varg&rsquo;s natural attacks count as silver for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction, and a varg may spend a standard action and touch a lycanthrope to give that lycanthrope an insight bonus equal to the half the varg&rsquo;s level plus his Wisdom modifier (minimum +1) to the target&rsquo;s check to change back to human form.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keen Senses: Vargs receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.</li>\n<li>Wolf Empathy: Vargs receive a +4 racial bonus on Handle Animal and Diplomacy checks when dealing with wolves, dire wolves, or any other wolf subtype.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bite: Vargs gain a natural bite attack, dealing 1d4 points of damage. The bite is a primary attack, or a secondary attack if the varg is wielding manufactured weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Darkvision: Vargs can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet.</li>\n<li>Scent: Vargs gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\">scent</a> ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emotionless: Vargs are distrustful and aloof. They do not like dealing with other races other than their own. They receive a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty on Diplomacy checks when dealing with other races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Civilized: Outcast vargs have learned to better integrate with society in an attempt to find a new pack. Vargs with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n<li>Cold Acclimated: Vargs are accustomed to the extreme temperatures of snowy and polar regions to the far north. Vargs with this racial trait have white fur and are immune to environmental damage from cold weather (below 40 degrees). In conditions of extreme cold (below 0 degrees), vargs suffer the normal conditions for cold weather, not the harsher conditions for extreme cold. In addition, vargs with this racial trait also gain Ice Resistance 5. This racial trait replaces the natural armor trait.</li>\n<li>Feral: Vargs with this trait give in to their animal natures at the expense of their intellects. A varg with this racial trait always has Perception and Stealth as class skills. In return for this racial trait, the varg starts with a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty to Intelligence.</li>\n<li>Heat Acclimated: Vargs are accustomed to the extreme temperatures of the plains and deserts they inhabit. Vargs with this racial trait automatically succeed on Fortitude saves to avoid heat dangers for conditions up to and including severe heat. This racial trait replaces the natural armor racial trait.</li>\n<li>Information Hunter: Outcast vargs who live in large settlements have learned to apply their hunting and scavenging instincts to more esoteric pursuits. Vargs with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and Knowledge (local) is always a class skill for them. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n<li>Light Build: Some vargs are light and proportionately weaker but more agile. These vargs start with a +2 bonus to Dexterity. This racial trait replaces the +2 Strength bonus.</li>\n<li>Influential: Exceptionally clever vargs take up the mantle of shaman for their tribes and use their gifts to more readily enslave varg captives. Vargs with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks and add +1 to the saving throw DCs for their spells of the enfeebling school that they cast. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n<li>Loper: Vargs find success by moving faster than their kin, sometimes at the expense of the thick fur protecting them. Vargs with this racial trait gain a +10 bonus to their base speed, and they gain an additional +10 foot racial bonus when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions. This racial trait replaces the natural armor racial trait.</li>\n<li>Midnight Child: Vargs are acclimated to the night so much that they are adept at dodging blows whilst hiding within it. Whenever a varg has concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of attacks against them increases by 5%. This racial trait replaces fearless.</li>\n<li>Midnight Eyes: Vargs are sometimes born with an extraordinary ability to see at night that far exceeds that of the average member of their race. Vargs gain darkvision that allows them to see in the dark up to 120 feet. This racial trait replaces darkvision and scent.</li>\n<li>Savant: One out of every thousand varg births results in a hairless varg, which the varg tribe deems as a great portent for the tribe&rsquo;s success. Vargs with this racial trait start with +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, and &ndash;<wbr />2 Constitution, and they have a +1 racial bonus on all saving throws. This racial trait replaces the starting attribute bonuses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Varg Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many vargs follow the general model of the varg, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 2 different potential heritages for varg PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a varg, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Empathy: While most varg gain a +4 racial bonus on Handle Animal and Diplomacy checks when dealing with wolves, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a different empathy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Varg Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-814\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 15%;\">Heritages</th>\n<th style=\"width: 15%;\">Ability Modifiers</th>\n<th style=\"width: 15%;\">Alternate Empathy</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Gnoll</td>\n<td>+2 STR, +2 INT, -2 CHA</td>\n<td>Hyenas</td>\n<td>Gnolls are a race of hulking, humanoids that resemble hyenas in more than mere appearance; they show a striking affinity with the scavenging animals, to the point of keeping them as pets, and reflect many of the lesser creatures&rsquo; behaviors.

Moombas with this trait receive <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-finesse-combat\">Weapon Finesse</a> as a bonus feat. This racial trait replaces bite.</li>\n<li>Scent: Following their ability to distinguish between people by their scent or blood, moombas with this trait gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities/#TOC-Scent\">scent</a> ability. This racial trait replaces darkvision and prehensile tail.</li>\n<li>Silent Spellcasting: Harmonising the magic within them, moombas learn the ability to cast spells without vocal components. Moombas with this trait gain the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/metamagic-feats/silent-spell\">Silent Spell</a> metamagic feat. This racial trait replaces desert runner and stability.</li>\n<li>Vocal Adept: Spending time on learning languages as well as the ability to broadcast a wider vocabulary the moombas can overcome their lack of proper vocals. Moombas with this trait no longer require linguistics checks to cast vocal spells. This trait replaces broken language, vocal failure, bite, claws, and slapping tail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to moombas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/chemist/archetypes/item_master/\">Item Master</a> (Chemist; Moomba)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favoured class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favoured class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favoured class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/beastmaster/\">Beastmaster</a>: Add +1 hit point or +1 skill rank to the beastmaster&rsquo;s animal companion.

They typically have red hair and yellow, slitted eyes. Although their limbs look to be slender, Gria possess powerful inner strength and athleticism. Male Gria have longer tails and larger horns and wings than their female counterparts. Gria have a somewhat matriarchal society in that females tend to be more active and outgoing than male members. While male Gria certainly exist, they prefer more peaceful and less dangerous jobs, this doesn’t mean that Males don’t go out and explore, of course, but a large majority of Gria seen questing are female.

Female sea wolf roegadyns have fair skin (even more so than males) and are slim compared to Hellsguard women, while the latter have more robust physiques and brownish skin compared to male Hellsguard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/roegadyn/\">View Roegadyn on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">15 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(16 &ndash; 19 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 years<br />(16 &ndash; 21 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d6 years<br />(17 &ndash; 27 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li>Self-Taught includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li>Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">35 years</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">65</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">90</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d20<br />(92 - 130 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">6 ft. 1 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d8 in.<br />(6 ft. 3 in. &ndash; 7 ft. 7 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">250 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d8x10 lbs.)<br />(270 &ndash; 410 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">5 ft. 11 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d8 in.<br />(6 ft. 1 in. &ndash; 7 ft. 5 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">175 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d8x8 lbs.)<br />(196 &ndash; 303 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits: Roegadyns are strong, boastful, but not too nimble.

Roegadyns with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Dwarven, Elvaan, Giant, Goblin, Lalafellan, and Orc. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hardy: Roegadyns receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, spells, and spell-<wbr />like abilities.</li>\n<li id=\"powerful-build\">Powerful Build: The physical stature of roegadyns lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a roegadyn is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for a Combat Maneuver Bonus or Combat Maneuver Defense (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the roegadyn is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A roegadyn is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature&rsquo;s special attacks based on size (such as grab or swallow whole) can affect him. The benefits of this racial trait don&rsquo;t stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject&rsquo;s size category (including Giant Weapon Wielder).</li>\n<li>Stability: Roegadyns receive a +4 bonus to their Combat Maneuver Defense when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Imposing Figure: Roegadyns are intimidating without trying. They gain a +2 racial bonus to Intimidate checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cornered Fury: Roegadyns that are reduced to half their hit points or fewer and have no conscious ally within 30 feet, they gain a +2 racial bonus on melee attack rolls and to Armor Class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-Light Vision: Roegadyns have low-light vision allowing them to see twice as far as humes in dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Battle-Hardened: Incessant drills make defense second nature to some roegadyns. Roegadyns with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus to CMD. This racial trait replaces stability.</li>\n<li>Ferocity: Once per day, when a roegadyn is brought below 0 hit points but not killed, he can fight on for 1 more round as if disabled. At the end of his next turn, unless brought to above 0 hit points, he immediately falls unconscious and begins dying. This racial trait replaces cornered fury.</li>\n<li>Sea Legs: Many roegadyns find their way onto the water early in their youth, whether they live with trader families, work as smugglers, or plunder alongside pirates. These roegadyns receive a +2 racial bonus on Swim checks, as well as a +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks to move on narrow or slippery surfaces, and on Climb checks on docks and ships. This racial trait replaces imposing figure.</li>\n<li>Stoic: Some roegadyns learn to suppress their strong emotions. They don&rsquo;t usually gain morale bonuses, but instead gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against emotion and fear effects, and the DC to intimidate them increases by 2. They can choose to gain morale bonuses when they would normally be able to do so, but if they do, they lose the benefits from this racial trait for 24 hours.

If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a <span lang=\"en-US\">roegadyn</span>, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Skill Modifiers: While most <span lang=\"en-US\">roegadyn</span>s gain a +2 racial bonus on <span lang=\"en-US\">Intimidate</span> checks, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a modifier to different skill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Roegadyn Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-649\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;

A nu mou with this racial trait adds half his class level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge skill checks and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained. This racial trait replaces sagacious.</li>\n<li>Magic Resistant: Some nu mous are particularly resistant to magic. Nu mous with this racial trait gain spell resistance equal to 10 + their character level. This resistance can be lowered for 1 round as a standard action.

If the nu mou gains proficiency with any of these weapons from their favored class, they gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with those specific weapons. This racial trait replaces adept.</li>\n<li>Sociable: Nu mous are skilled at charming others and recovering from faux pas. If nu mous with this racial trait attempt to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude with a Diplomacy check and fail by 5 or more, they can try to influence the creature a second time even if 24 hours have not passed. This racial trait replaces sagacious.</li>\n<li>Sociable Intellectual: Some nu mous, though still excellent scholars, are able to hold discourse more effectively, though they lack the common sense common to the race. Nu mous with this racial trait gain +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma and -2 Constitution. This racial trait replaces their standard ability scores.</li>\n<li>Threats Known: Rather than study history or magic, some nu mous learn all they can of various creatures and races. A nu mou with this racial trait can make an appropriate Knowledge check when first encountering a foe. A successful check grants the nu mou the normal benefits of such a check, plus one of the following benefits for 1 minute: +4 initiative, +1 dodge to AC, +2 to one saving throw versus a known attack or ability. Making this check is a free action. If a nu mou spends a move action when making this check, he can impart the benefit to an ally instead of himself.

This, however, has long been disputed, with scholars citing several distinct differences in the two races as evidence of decidedly dissimilar roots&mdash;the first and foremost being the enhanced hearing and spatial recognition granted by auri&rsquo;s cranial projections (traits not attributed to draconian horns), and the second being the gross disproportion of body mass between auri males and females (again, a trait widely unseen in dragons). The auri are split into two clans, the Raen and Xaela.</p>\n<p>Auri creation myth tells of a Dawn Father and a Dusk Mother from whom all auri are descended. The Raen believe their veins to run thick with the blood of the former&mdash;their brilliant white scales and iron wills serving as proof of this divine lineage. The Xaela believe their veins to run thick with the blood of the latter&mdash;their lustrous black scales and fiery wills serving as proof of this divine lineage.</p>\n<p>Raen, unlike their sister clan, the Xaela, who bloody the land with their endless tribal conflict, have embraced a life of tranquility and solitude, long abandoning the nomadic lifestyle of their ancestors to settle the deep valleys of Othard&rsquo;s mountainous eastern reaches. Only on rare occasions will one emerge from the valley mists to seek adventure in realms afar. The Xaela however, are free spirits who roam the vast western steppe in close-<wbr />knit tribes hunting, gathering, and warring as their ancestors have for countless generations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/au-ra/\">View Au Ra on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">12 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(13 &ndash; 16 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 years<br />(13 &ndash; 18 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d6 years<br />(14 &ndash; 24 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Intuitive includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Self-Taught includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">30 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">35</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">60</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">+2d10<br />(62 - 80 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">6 ft. 3 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 in.<br />(6 ft. 4 in. &ndash; 6 ft. 9 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">185 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(1d6x8 lbs.)<br />(193 &ndash; 233 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 9 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d8 in.<br />(4 ft. 10 in. &ndash; 5 ft. 5 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">115 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(1d8x4 lbs.)<br />(119 &ndash; 147 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits: The Raen and Xaela clans have different attributes.

They typically have red hair and yellow, slitted eyes. Although their limbs look to be slender, Gria possess powerful inner strength and athleticism. Male Gria have longer tails and larger horns and wings than their female counterparts. Gria have a somewhat matriarchal society in that females tend to be more active and outgoing than male members. While male Gria certainly exist, they prefer more peaceful and less dangerous jobs, this doesn’t mean that Males don’t go out and explore, of course, but a large majority of Gria seen questing are female.

They gain +2 Strength, +2 Charisma, and –2 Wisdom.</li><li>Size: Gria are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li><li>Type: Gria are Humanoid creatures with the gria subtype.</li><li>Base Speed: Gria have a base speed of 30 feet on land. While gria wings are too small to provide true flight, the same magic that empowers dragons allows gria to achieve limited flight for short periods of time while wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. A gria can fly with clumsy maneuverability a number of rounds at a time equal to her Constitution bonus. A gria can attempt to fly for longer durations by making Constitution check each additional round of flight (DC 10 + 2 per extra round). A gria’s natural fly speed is equal to her base land speed. After flying, a gria must rest a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent flying before flying again.</li><li>Languages: Gria begin play speaking Common and Draconic. Gria with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Banganese, Giant, Goblin, Ignan, Seeq, Terran.

In addition, if a gria fails such a save, it receives another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect (assuming the spell or spell-like ability has a duration greater than 1 round). This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If the gria has a similar ability from another source, it can only use one of these abilities per round, but can try the other on the second round if the first reroll ability fails.</li></ul><h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3><ul><li>@UUID[Compendium.ffd20-content.ffd20-races-base.GqiRezbQnMHxes10]{Gria Trait - Athleticism}: Gria are naturally fit and nimble.

A gria who follows the calling of her ancestors gains a +2 bonus to Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (geography) checks. These are considered class skills for the gria with this racial trait. This racial trait replaces athleticism and survivalist.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.ffd20-content.ffd20-races-base.7OYW2aF4tNVsbbEd]{Ferocity}: Some gria give themselves over completely to their race’s aggressive tendencies, channeling their competitive spirit into a bloodlust. Once per day, when brought below 0 hit points but not killed, a gria can fight on for 1 more round as if disabled. At the end of her next turn, unless brought to above 0 hit points, she immediately falls unconscious and begins dying. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.ffd20-content.ffd20-races-base.9GSYWKmR43CCROz5]{Fleet-Footed}: While all gria are naturally lithe and agile, some also are naturally speedy and have a strong desire to rush into situations rather than worrying about looking ahead. Gria with this racial trait receive <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/run-final/\">Run</a> as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks.

Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beguiling Liar: Many seeq find that the best way to get along in the world is to tell others what they want to hear. These seeq practice of telling habitual falsehoods, granting them a +4 racial bonus on Bluff checks to convince an opponent that what they are saying is true when they tell a lie. This racial trait replaces perceptive.</li>\n<li>Cornered Fury: Seeq can fight viciously when cut off from friends and allies. Whenever a seeq with this racial trait is reduced to half or fewer of his hit points, and has no conscious ally within 30 feet, he gains a +2 racial bonus on melee attack rolls and to Armor Class. This racial trait replaces stability.</li>\n<li>Gift of Gab: While most seeq that take on roles of service adopt stoic personas, some seeq, especially those seeq who are independent, gather information by out-<wbr />talking those around them, listening all the while to words muttered into mugs and whispered around corners. A seeq with this racial trait gains a +4 racial bonus to Diplomacy checks made when gathering information. This racial trait replaces perceptive.</li>\n<li>Greed: Some seeq merely allow their chosen mercantile trade to earn them profit, casting aside the &ldquo;dim and dull&rdquo; illusion. Seeq with this racial trat gain a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks made to determine the price of nonmagical goods. This racial trait replaces the deceptive racial trait.</li>\n<li>Nimble: Occasionally there are seeq who move with a grace not possessed by the rest of their race.

This racial trait replaces hardy.</li>\n<li>Scent: Some seeq have much more strongly developed senses of smell, instead of keen eyes and ears. These seeq have the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\">scent</a> ability, but take a &ndash;2 penalty on all Perception checks based primarily on sight or hearing.

Shindroids are created, not born, and come into the world fully mature. The strange, alien forges in which new shindroids are created are hidden in Shinra facilities, and most have little to no memories of their &ldquo;birth&rdquo; places. Strange circuitry-<wbr />like markings that look like faintly glowing tattoos, a faint metallic sheen to the eyes, and watery, almost translucent red blood are all ways to tell a shindroid from a hume&ndash;providing its awkward mannerisms haven&rsquo;t revealed the truth already.</p>\n<p>Some shindroids are built to serve their masters, while others are sold to interested buyers looking for loyal servants.

They never die of natural causes, and they are immune to any attacks or effects that age a character.</li>\n<li>Self-<wbr />Sustained: Shindroids do not eat, drink or breathe. Therefore, they are immune to the effects of starvation, suffocation and thirst. On the other hand, shindroid have no sense of smell or taste, and they cannot benefit from the effects of consumable spells or magic items. A shindroid can still use oils and potions as long as they don&rsquo;t heal hit points, unless they have the Living Construct feat (see below).</li>\n<li>Undying: A shindroid responds slightly differently from other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. A shindroid with 0 hit points is disabled, just like any living creature. He can only take a single move action or standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk further injury. However, when his hit point total is &ndash;<wbr />1 or lower, a shindroid is inert (instead of dying). He is unconscious and helpless, and he cannot perform any actions. However, an inert shindroid does not lose additional hit points (unless more damage is dealt to him). A shindroid, whose negative hit point total drops to or below its Constitution score, dies like any living creature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emotionless: Shindroids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a &ndash;4 penalty on Sense Motive checks.</li>\n<li>High Maintenance: Shindroids healed by healing spells and effects works at 50% efficiency except spells and effects that grant fast healing. They, however, do not benefit from the Heal skill. But, shindroids can be repaired by the Repair skill.</li>\n<li>Magic Ineptitude: Shindroids are inept with magic. They are unable to obtain MP nor can they use spell-trigger items, spell-completion items, command word activated item, or use activated items. Shindroids can use alchemical items and may activate and deactivate their magic weapons and armor without issue as well as gain bonuses from static magical wondrous items and rings like belts of giant strength.</li>\n<li>Rejuvenation Cycle: A shindroid runs on energy cells that need to rejuvenate regularly. During a 24-<wbr />hour period, it must shut down for 8 hours to replenish its energy supply. During its rejuvenation cycle, the shindroid is essentially asleep. If it fails to rejuvenate, it suffers a cumulative &ndash;<wbr />1 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws each day until it fully recharges itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following racial traits replace existing shindroid racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anomaly: Sometimes, a particularly volatile soul can overwhelm the technology of a shindroid body, making the resulting individual subject to emotions, and greatly so. Anomalous shindroids suffer a &ndash;2 racial penalty on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects, emotion effects, and fear effects but can gain the benefits of morale bonuses and suffer no penalty on Sense Motive checks. Additionally, Bluff and Sense Motive are always class skills for them. This racial trait modifies constructed and replaces emotionless.</li>\n<li>Body Double: Rather than combat, the shindroid was created to resemble a specific creature of the same size category. The shindroid does not take a racial penalty to Charisma and it gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate that creature. Some shindroid of this type are capable of sleeping, though they do not require it. This racial trait replaces part robot, emotionless, and composite plating.</li>\n<li>Endure Elements: Some shindroids have well-insulated interiors. A shindroid with this racial trait is permanently affected as if by an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/e/endure-elements\">Endure Elements</a> spell that cannot be dispelled. This racial trait replaces composite plating and part robot.</li>\n<li>Factual: While most shindroids have difficulty processing emotions, others instead have an inability to imagine things outside of physical and factual reality, making it difficult for them to deceive others. Such shindroids suffer a &ndash;4 penalty on Bluff checks. This racial trait replaces emotionless.</li>\n<li>Force Field: A force field sheathes a shindroid in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants a number of bonus hit points equal to 5 x the character level of the shindroid. All damage dealt to a shindroid with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. These temporary hit points are not affected by damage reduction and elemental resistance. As long as the force field is active, the shindroid is immune to critical hits but not to precision damage. A force field has fast healing equal to half the shindroid&rsquo;s character level (minimum 1), but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours. This racial trait replaces part robot, perceptive and composite plating.</li>\n<li>Heavy Platform: Some shindroids were constructed to operate heavy machinery and transport heavy loads, being designed with an extra robust &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; analogue. This increases the weight of the Shindroid by +50 lbs and reduces their base speed by -10 ft (from 30 to 20), but in return their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance. This racial trait replaces the shindroid&rsquo;s movement speed.</li>\n<li>Infiltration Unit: A shindroid with this racial trait has to eat and drink like normal humanoids. They are also able to benefit from potions and oils. This racial trait replaces self-sustained.</li>\n<li>Integrated Weaponry: A shindroid has a 1-handed firearm built into its arm, it treats such weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons attacks, and cannot make iterative attacks with these weapons. Integrated weaponry can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder attempts), but as a general rule cannot be harvested for use outside of the shindroid&rsquo;s body once the shindroid is destroyed. A shindroid is always proficient with its integrated weapons. Integrated ranged weapons do not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat. A shindroid&rsquo;s core can process scrap metal into new ammunition, effectively giving the shindroid infinite ammo with these weapons. This racial trait replaces composite plating and natural weapons.</li>\n<li>Ironspy: Shindroid bodies built for stealth and infiltration employ camouflage circuitry. Shindroids with this trait reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving at full speed by 5 and reduce the Stealth check penalty for sniping by 10. This racial trait replaces composite plating.</li>\n<li>Magitek Unit: A shindroid obtains an essence of magitek technology, allowing it to be able to obtain MP and activate magical items.

Ronsos are humanoid in stature, standing above two meters in average height (with the males considerably larger and more muscular than the females, who possess a &ldquo;faster&rdquo;, more athletic body type). They are feline in appearance, possessing hands/claws and foot paws, they walk on (what would be for humes) the balls of their feet and possess dew-<wbr />claws as well as foot pads. Possessing lion-<wbr />like tails that roughly measure half of their body lengths, Ronso bodies are covered in blue fur (perhaps a trait due to their living in a winter climate) with patches of white (though the color has differed to either a darker blue or yellow depending on the individual) fur around the thighs, calves, shoulders, chest (males), tail-<wbr />tips, and scalp. The abundance of the fur the patches consist of seems to be greater on the males than the females, based on observation. The scalp fur, or mane, is usually tied back or styled in a similar way to hair. In regards to facial appearances, Ronsos differ in comparison to humes, again they possess feline attributes like muzzles and fangs as well as a distinct cat-<wbr />like nose. Their ears, while located similar to humans, possess a more elvaan shape and are thought to be capable of articulation similar to cats. The male Ronso possess a singular horn that grows from the forehead and denotes status and power. The females do not seem to have this attribute. For the males, the horn is a symbol of their strength and pride, and to lose the horn in battle is considered shameful. Both genders possess carnivore fangs, hinting that they may be meat eaters (it is unknown if they are omnivores).

Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Battle-<wbr />Hardened: Incessant drills make defense second nature to some ronsos. Ronsos with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus to CMD. This racial trait replaces survivalist.</li>\n<li>Fearsome: Some ronsos scorn caution and subtlety for swagger and bluster. Ronsos with this racial trait gain a +4 racial bonus on Intimidate checks. This racial trait replaces intimidating build and survivalist.</li>\n<li>Hornless: Due to intent or misfortune, these ronsos have lost their horns. Ronsos with this racial trait take a -4 penalty on Diplomacy, Bluff and Intimidate checks made against their fellow Ronsos, but their scorn has hardened their will, granting the ronsos with this racial trait a +1 bonus on all Will saves. This ability replaces gore.</li>\n<li>Lion&rsquo;s Claws: Some ronsos have stronger and more developed claws than other members of their race, and can use them to make attacks. Ronsos with this racial trait have a pair of claws they can use as natural weapons. These claws are primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage. This racial trait replaces arctic fur.</li>\n<li>Magehunter: Ronsos hate and fear spellcasters. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify a spell being cast and a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against spellcasters. They only gain this bonus against creatures that use spells, and not against those that only use spell-<wbr />like abilities. This racial trait replaces fearless.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Ronso Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many <span lang=\"en-US\">ronso</span>s follow the general model of the standard <span lang=\"en-US\">ronso</span>, many more do not.

Though due to their life near and within water, they have a swim speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages: Hypellos begin play speaking Common and Hypello. Hypellos with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Moogle, Goblin, Sylvan, Dwarven. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Camouflage: Hypellos receive a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks in marshes and forested areas.</li>\n<li>Hardy: Hypellos gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, spells, and spell-like abilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Amphibians: Hypellos begin with the Amphibious racial trait, allowing them to breathe both air and water.</li>\n<li>Animal Empathy: Hypellos gain a +2 to all Handle Animal checks made to influence animals.</li>\n<li>Rider: Hypellos gain a +2 on Ride checks.</li>\n<li>Ride ze Shoopuf?: Hypellos treat Handle Animal and Ride as class skills.</li>\n<li>Swim: Hypellos have a swim speed of 30 feet and gain the +8 racial bonus on swim checks that a swim speed normally grants.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Movement Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Swamp Stride: A hypello can move through difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a hypello normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Darkvision: Hypellos can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor Communication: Due to their vocal patterns and childish demeanor, hypellos gain a -2 to Diplomacy and Intimidation checks against all other races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defensive Training: Hypellos often live in close proximity to very large animals and dangerous creatures they must learn to avoid in order to survive. They gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against Large or larger animals and magical beasts. This racial trait replaces swamp stride.</li>\n<li>Fishy Merchant: Hypellos who put themselves up as tradesmen do surprisingly well, regardless of their speech. Hypellos with this racial trait gain a racial bonus of +2 to Bluff and Diplomacy checks, as well as ignoring their Poor Communication trait, when engaging in a trade. This racial trait replaces animal empathy and rider.</li>\n<li>Glider: Hypellos&rsquo; aerodynamic bodies and thick webbing between the toes enable a falling hypello to treat the distance fallen as half the actual distance. The hypello can steer himself while falling, moving horizontally up to a number of feet equal to half the vertical distance fallen. The hypello cannot use this trait if it is wearing heavy armor, is carrying a heavy load, or is unable to react to the fall (such as being helpless). This racial trait replaces swamp stride.</li>\n<li>Land Lubber: Some hypellos stay away from the waters, taking to the sky in airships or settling in towns, as such their legs are stronger than others in exchange of their swimming ability. Hypellos with this racial trait increase their base speed to 30 feet.

Their greatest achievement is the Way of the Gourmand, which sums every aspects of their life. The Way of the Gourmand defines the life of a Qu. Knowledge, power and personal growth can be attained by eating and discovering new knowledge of food. They have somewhat limited attention spans and wit, despite not being stupid at all, but won&rsquo;t try to understand what is beyond their own limits. They are grounded in reality and won&rsquo;t be impaired by the chaos around them or dramatic events. Qus are tall, bulky humanoids with a pale, milky skin. Their almost featureless body is covered by strong muscles and healthy fat. Their round belly occupies most of their body mass, their most powerful asset. Their bulbous head and short, stumpy legs generally make them above 6 feet tall. Their long, lanky arms hang to the sides of their body when left unattended. The Qu&rsquo;s faces are commonly described as &ldquo;a gross, doll-<wbr />looking face with rounded, cross-<wbr />shaped eyes and a wound-<wbr />like mouth going side to side, gifted with a tongue larger than my arm.&rdquo; They favor brightly colored clothes and cook outfits, and usually weigh about 400 pounds. The Qus are truly affectionate beings and love spending time with friends, as long as these agree to help on the Way of the Gourmand (by catching some exotic food, for example).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/qu/\">View Qu on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">9 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d3 years<br />(10 &ndash; 12 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d3 years<br />(11 &ndash; 15 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+3d3 years<br />(12 &ndash; 18 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li>Self-Taught includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li>Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">120 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">150</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">200</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">+2d20<br />(202 - 240 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">5 ft. 0 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d12 in.<br />(5 ft. 2 in. &ndash; 7 ft. 0 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">350 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d12x10 lbs.)<br />(370 &ndash; 590 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits: Qus are resilient and smart, but their monstrous appearance makes people fearful of interacting with them.

This racial trait replaces expert chefs.</li>\n<li>Scavenger: Some qus eke out a leaving picking over the garbage heaps of society, and must learn to separate rare finds from the inevitable dross. Qus with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks and on Perception checks to find hidden objects (including traps and secret doors), determine whether food is spoiled, or identify a potion by taste. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Unnatural: Some qus unnerve normal animals, and train to defend themselves against the inevitable attacks from such creatures. These qus take a &ndash;4 penalty on all Charisma-<wbr />based skill checks to affect creatures of the animal type, and receive a +2 dodge bonus to AC against animals.

They never die of natural causes, and they are immune to any attacks or effects that ages a character.</li>\n<li>Undying: I<span lang=\"en-US\">mmortals</span> respond slightly differently from other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. <span lang=\"en-US\">Immortals</span> with 0 hit points is disabled, just like any living creature. <span lang=\"en-US\">They</span> can only take a single move action or standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk further injury. However, when their hit point total is -1 or lower, immortals are inert (instead of dying) regardless of any abilities that would otherwise keep them conscious such as the Die Hard feat, ferocity, or similar abilities. <span lang=\"en-US\">They are</span> unconscious and helpless, and they cannot perform any actions. However, inert <span lang=\"en-US\">immortals</span> do not lose additional hit points (unless more damage is dealt to them). <span lang=\"en-US\">Immortals</span>, whose negative hit point total drops to or below their Constitution score, do not die like any living creature, they instead gain 1 permanent negative level and fast healing equal to half their character level until back to 0 hit points or higher. This negative level stacks up to their character level &ndash; 1. If the maximum number of negative levels are reached, they instead remain inert until cured of a negative level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Magic Ineptitude: Immortals are inept with magic. They are unable to obtain a magic pool nor can they use spell-trigger items, spell-completion items, command word activated item, or use activated items except through their linking (see above). <span lang=\"en-US\">Immortal</span>s can use alchemical items and may activate and deactivate their magic weapons and armor without issue as well as gain bonuses from static magical wondrous items and rings like belts of giant strength.</li>\n<li>Not of this Plane: An immortal&rsquo;s connection to the Material Plane can be severed and altered, causing a weakness to occur where they did not anticipate. If subject to a successful dispel check (DC 10 + their hit die + their Wisdom modifier), without any current active effects, they are knocked unconscious for a number of rounds equal to the CL of the enemy who used the dispel. Likewise, any Immortal caught in an anti-magic field or similar effect is knocked unconscious until their body leaves the vicinity of the effect. Immortals are also affected by any spells that negatively affect outsiders or summoned creatures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Background Character: <span lang=\"en-US\">Immortal</span>s who stay away from others are more adept at blending in or hiding away rather than fitting in. <span lang=\"en-US\">Immortal</span>s with this racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Disguise, Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Stealth checks. This racial trait replaces integrated.</li>\n<li>Blank Slate: Some <span lang=\"en-US\">immortals</span> are bereft of memories of their long lives but can accomplish great improvisations. <span lang=\"en-US\">Immortals</span> with this racial trait can, once per day as a free action, treat any skill as though they had a number of ranks equal to half of their character levels for one skill check (minimum 1 rank). This racial trait replaces <span lang=\"en-US\">long-lived</span>.</li>\n<li>Explorer: Many <span lang=\"en-US\">immortal</span>s are obsessed with seeing as much of the world as possible, rather than perfecting some specific talent or vocation. These <span lang=\"en-US\">immortal</span>s gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim checks and these skills are always considered class skills. This racial trait replaces <span lang=\"en-US\">long-lived</span>.</li>\n<li>Emissary: Some immortals work to make others believe a single statement rather than improve relations. Once per day, <span lang=\"en-US\">immortal</span>s may roll twice on a single Bluff or Diplomacy check and take the better roll. This racial trait replaces sociable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to immortals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/sword-saint/archetypes/sworn-protector/\">Sworn Protector</a> (Sword Saint; Immortal)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/\">Archer</a>: Add +1/4 to the archer&rsquo;s damage rolls with bows and crossbows.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/beastmaster/\">Beastmaster</a>: Add +1 hit point or +1 skill rank to the beastmaster&rsquo;s animal companion.

{"name":"Aegyl","type":"race","flags":{"importid":"StUttDK3FoKYSMvf","cf":{"id":"temp_rdvg4ywquo"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The aegyl resemble humes, except they have large feathery wings on their back. These wings can come in different colors, from brown to red to black. These wings allow the aegyl to fly with no problems. However, the strain they put on their body means they have the shortest life span of any race in Ivalice, only living for forty years. All aegyl are cold and aloof. They are either incapable at showing emotions, or do not feel them at all. The aegyl are not too keen on other races, since most of the Sky Pirates who arrived either attacked or enslaved them. Aegyl make their home in many stone edifices erected over several of Lemur&eacute;s&rsquo;s continents. These homes were built by the first generation of aegyl to reach Lemur&eacute;s following their banishment by the Occuria. Successive generations have elected to inhabit these century-<wbr />old dwellings rather than construct new ones, an effort made easier by the small aegyl population. According to the Folio, aegyl are mostly vegetarians, the majority of their diet being wild fruits and vegetables. The Damson, a plump red fruit that grows in the Bosco Pampa, appears to be their favorite. Aegyl harvest the waters of Lemur&eacute;s for native fish, and eggs are also a part of their cuisine. However, other hunting sources are nonexistent, as the Yarhi beasts that would normally yield meat are but illusions, and fade to nothing when killed. Since the climate of Lemur&eacute;s is mostly tropical, aegyl garb is light and geared for flight. Indeed, most aegyl males do not wear an upper garment, and aegyl armor is likewise sparsely distributed over the aegyl form. As Llyud exemplifies, aegyl jewelry is simplistic, being of lightweight gold and lacking in inlaid jewels. This absence of exquisite garments is yet another indication of aegyl humility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/aegyl/\">View Aegyl on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">12 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(13 &ndash; 16 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 years<br />(13 &ndash; 18 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d4 years<br />(14 &ndash; 20 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Intuitive includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Self-Taught includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">20 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">27</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">35</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">+2d4<br />(37 - 43 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 10 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d10 in.<br />(5 ft. &ndash; 6 ft. 6 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">120 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d10x4 lbs.)<br />(128 &ndash; 200 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 5 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d10 in.<br />(4 ft. 7 in. &ndash; 6 ft. 1 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">85 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d10x4 lbs.)<br />(93 &ndash; 165 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits: Aegyls are very agile and possess an aptitude for tactics, but have a weaker bone structure than other humanoids and are very cold and aloof.

They receive a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty on Diplomacy checks when dealing with other races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oppressive: Aegyls often have a natural talent for sensing how to unsettle and oppress other creatures. As a swift action, an aegyl can attempt a Sense Motive check against a DC of 10 + a creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier or a DC of 10 + the creature&rsquo;s Bluff modifier, whichever is higher. On a success, the aegyl gains a +4 racial bonus on Intimidate checks against that target and a +1 racial bonus to the DC of any fear effects she uses against that target. This racial trait replaces keen senses and emotionless.</li>\n<li>Weather Savvy: Some aegyls are so in tune with the air and sky that they can sense the slightest change in atmospheric conditions. Aegyls with this trait can spend a full-<wbr />round action to predict the weather in an area for the next 24 hours. The aegyl&rsquo;s prediction is always accurate, but cannot account for spells or supernatural effects that might alter the forecast. This racial trait replaces the aegyl&rsquo;s keen senses racial trait.</li>\n<li>Wing-<wbr />Clipped: The flight of wing-<wbr />clipped aegyl is weaker than normal, whether from deformity or injury. Their fly speed is 20 feet (poor) instead of the normal fly speed, and they must make a DC 30 Fly check to fly upward. Ostracized by their own race and forced to deal with other races, these aegyl compensate for their weakness by gaining a +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Climb, and Diplomacy checks and removes the aegyl&rsquo;s emotionless racial trait.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Feats</h2>\n<p>The following feats are available to an aegyl character who meets the prerequisites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/airy-step-aegyl\">Airy Step</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/cloud-gazer-aegyl\">Cloud Gazer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/stretched-wings-aegyl\">Stretched Wings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/wings-of-air-aegyl\">Wings of Air</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to aegyls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/fighter/archetypes/airborne-ambusher/\">Airborne Ambusher</a> (Fighter; Aegyl)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/geomancer/archetypes/skyseer/\">Skyseer</a> (Geomancer, Aegyl)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/beastmaster/\">Beastmaster</a>: Add +1 to an animal companion&rsquo;s CMD when adjacent to the beastmaster.

In addition, if a viera fails such a save, it receives another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect (assuming the spell or spell-like ability has a duration greater than 1 round). This second save is made at the same DC as the first.

The auri are split into two clans, the Raen and Xaela.</p>\n<p>Auri creation myth tells of a Dawn Father and a Dusk Mother from whom all auri are descended.

The Ascian Emet-Selch, assuming the identity of a brilliant Legatus named Solus zos Galvus, brought about a technological revolution with the discovery of ceruleum. Solus established Garlemald as a world power within a single generation with himself as its emperor.

Closer inspection reveals a few key differences, however. Burmecians&rsquo; teeth are sharp, but lack the elongated incisors so typical of most rodents; their skin is smooth and almost entirely hairless, and tends to be gray or brown in coloration. Though they retain the sensitive snouts of their ancestors, burmecians do not sport whiskers; their ears are large and upraised, giving them a certain rabbit-<wbr />like air. In combat, they are more likely to rely on their hearing than their relatively weak eyesight, a fact that gives them an edge in dark and confined quarters. Unusual too are their double-<wbr />jointed legs and wide feet, both of which are capable of absorbing tremendous kinetic energy; with training, burmecians can leap distances nearly three to four times higher and wider than their human counterparts and survive substantial drops with almost no ill effects.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/burmecian/\">View Burmecian on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

They gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, and &ndash;<wbr />2 Charisma.</li>\n<li>Size: Burmecians are Medium creatures, and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Type: Burmecians are Humanoid creatures with the burmecian subtype.</li>\n<li>Base Speed: Burmecians have a base speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages: Burmecians begin play speaking Common and Burmecian. Burmecian with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Draconic, Dwarven, Elvaan, Galkan, Giant, Goblin, and Orc. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Battle-<wbr />Hardened: Incessant drills make defense second nature to all burmecians.

The claws are a primary attack, or a secondary attack if the burmecian is wielding manufactured weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleyran Ancestry: Sickened by the Burmecians&rsquo; dedication to war, a separatist group left the Realm of Eternal Rain and founded a new city in a giant tree to the west. When burmecians with this racial trait successfully use Diplomacy to win over an individual, that creature takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attempts to resist any of the member&rsquo;s Charisma-based skills for the next 24 hours. In addition, burmecians with this racial trait gain a +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, and -2 Strength. This racial trait replaces fearless and the starting burmecian ability score traits.</li>\n<li>Cornered Fury: Burmecians can fight viciously when cut off from friends and allies. Whenever a burmecian is reduced to half or fewer of his hit points, and has no conscious ally within 30 feet, he gains a +2 racial bonus on melee attack rolls and to Armor Class. This racial trait replaces battle-hardened and quick reactions.</li>\n<li>Disease Immunity: Some burmecians are immune to non-magical diseases. If a burmecian with this racial trait loses a saving throw against disease, he becomes a carrier and can transmit the disease through his claws for 1 week. This racial trait replaces battle-hardened and fearless.</li>\n<li>Market Dweller: Some burmecians are practiced at taking advantage of foes. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Sense Motive, and Sleight of Hand checks. This racial trait replaces keen senses and natural jumper.</li>\n<li>Rodent Empathy: Some burmecians are able to control rodents and gain a +4 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks made to influence rodents. This racial trait replaces natural jumper.</li>\n<li>Scent: Some burmecians have much more strongly developed senses of smell, instead of keen eyes and ears. These burmecians have the <a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\">scent</a> ability, but take a &ndash;2 penalty on all Perception checks based primarily on sight or hearing. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n<li>Skulk: Some burmecians can blend easily into their environments, and move with surprising grace. Burmecians gain a +2 racial bonus on Stealth checks, and take only a &ndash;5 penalty on Stealth checks made to hide from creatures they have distracted with a Bluff check (rather than the normal &ndash;10 penalty). This racial trait replaces natural jumper.</li>\n<li>Unnatural: Some burmecians unnerve normal animals, and train to defend themselves against the inevitable attacks from such creatures. These burmecians take a &ndash;4 penalty on all Charisma-<wbr />based skill checks to affect creatures of the animal type, and receive a +2 dodge bonus to AC against animals. An animal&rsquo;s starting attitude toward burmecians is one step worse than normal.

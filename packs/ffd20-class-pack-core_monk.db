features of the monk.</p><h3 id=\"weapon-and-armor-proficiency\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3><p>Monks are proficient with certain basic peasant weapons and some special weapons that are part of monk training. The weapons with which a monk is proficient are club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, sling, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality. Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields—in fact, many of the monk’s special powers require unfettered movement. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the monk receives the Limit Breaks (Absolute Perfection and Flawless Fists).</p><p><em>Absolute Perfection (Su):</em> This Limit Break allows the monk to gain perfection in herself for a short period of time. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four monk levels after 1st, the monk gains a +1 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls, and a damage reduction of 2/-. For every four monk levels after 1st, she gains an additional +1 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls, and damage reduction of 2/-. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><p><em>Flawless Fists (Su):</em> This Limit Break allows the monk to perfectly flow her ki around her body, sharpening her body to a fine edge. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four monk levels after 1st, the monk ignores damage reduction and hardness up to double her monk level when using unarmed strikes. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><h3 id=\"martial-arts\">Martial Arts (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, a monk gains <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-unarmed-strike-combat-final/\">Improved Unarmed Strike</a> as a bonus feat. Monks are highly trained in fighting unarmed, giving them considerable advantages when doing so. A monk’s attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes. Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling. A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on the table below. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see the following table. A monk’s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p><h2>Table: Small, Medium, or Large Monk Unarmed Damage</h2><table><thead><tr class=\"row-1\"><th>Level</th><th>Damage (Small)</th><th>Damage (Medium)</th><th>Damage (Large)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"row-2\"><td>1st – 3rd</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td></tr><tr class=\"row-3\"><td>4th – 7th</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr class=\"row-4\"><td>8th – 11th</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr class=\"row-5\"><td>12th – 15th</td><td>1d10</td><td>2d6</td><td>3d6</td></tr><tr class=\"row-6\"><td>16th – 19th</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>3d8</td></tr><tr class=\"row-7\"><td>20th+</td><td>2d8</td><td>2d10</td><td>4d8</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=\"blitz-techniques\">Blitz Techniques (Ex)</h3><p>Also at 1st level, a monk can utilize these techniques to enable combo finishers (see below).

Each combo finisher requires a certain amount of blitz techniques in order that must hit and be completed before the end of her next turn of the last successive hit or the monk must start over. Any blitz techniques used in part to fulfill a combo finisher may be used on any number of creatures. In addition, once the monk is able to use a combo finisher, she must activate it before the end of her next turn or its lost.</p><p>The monk may activate a combo finisher as a swift action, unless indicated otherwise on the ability. If the combo finisher requires an attack roll, it replaces a melee or ranged attack respectively from her next attack made before the end of her next round. All combo finishers with an attack component are made at the highest base attack bonus. Any combo finisher that adds extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit, but are added to the total.</p><ul><li>A complete list of monk combo finishers can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/monk/combo-finishers/\">Combo Finishers</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"ac-bonus\">AC Bonus (Ex)</h3><p>A monk is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks.</p><p>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) (this bonus is halved if she has a level in another non-prestige class and this is not her favored class) to her AC and her CMD. If the monk gains an attribute bonus to her AC or CMD from some other source, it does not stack.</p><p>In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed.</p><p>She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.</p><h3 id=\"flurry-of-blows\">Flurry of Blows (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at her highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/h/haste/\"><em>haste</em></a> and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of her unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. She takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but she does not gain any additional attacks beyond what’s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (She can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from <em>haste </em>and similar effects).</p><p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at her highest base attack bonus whenever she makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from <em>haste</em> and similar effects.</p><h3 id=\"stunning-fist\">Stunning Fist (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, the monk gains <a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/stunning-fist-combat/\">Stunning Fist</a> as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.</p><p>At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of her Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect.</p><p>At 4th level, she can choose to make the target fatigued.</p><p>At 8th level, she can make the target sickened for 1 minute.</p><p>At 12th level, she can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds.</p><p>At 16th level, she can permanently blind or deafen the target.</p><p>At 20th level, she can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds.</p><p>The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature sickened by Stunning Fist cannot become nauseated if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p><h3 id=\"evasion\">Evasion (Ex)</h3><p>At 2nd level or higher, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p><h3 id=\"martial-arts-talent\">Martial Arts Talent</h3><p>As a monk gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, the monk gains one martial arts talent. She gains an additional martial arts talent for every 2 levels of monk attained after 2nd level. Unless specified otherwise, a monk cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p><ul><li>A complete list of martial arts talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/monk/martial-arts-talents/\">Martial Arts Talents</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"ki-pool\">Ki Pool (Su)</h3><p>At 2nd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk’s ki pool is equal to half her monk level + her Wisdom modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she can make a ki strike.</p><p>At 4th level, ki strike allows her unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>At 7th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as being aligned, based upon her alignment. If the monk has an alignment that is not Neutral along either the Law-Chaos or Good-Evil axis, her unarmed attacks count as that alignment (for example, a Lawful Good monk’s unarmed attacks are counted as both Lawfully-aligned and Good-aligned). If the monk’s alignment along either axis is Neutral, she must either choose an end of that axis to count her unarmed strikes as, or she may instead retain her neutrality and count her unarmed strikes as neither alignment.</p><p>At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p><p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at her highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from her ki pool as she gains levels.</p><p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p><h3 id=\"ki-powers\">Ki Powers (Su)</h3><p>At 3rd level and every three monk levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from her ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p><ul><li>A complete list of monk ki powers can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/monk/ki-powers/\">Ki Powers</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"fast-movement\">Fast Movement (Ex)</h3><p>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her land speed, as shown on the table above. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p><h3 id=\"martial-arts-master\">Martial Arts Master (Ex)</h3><p>At 4th level, a monk may use her monk level to qualify for feats with a fighter level prerequisite when those feats are applied to unarmed strikes.</p><h3 id=\"purity-of-body\">Purity of Body (Ex)</h3><p>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p><h3 id=\"boost\">Boost (Ex)</h3><p>At 8th level, a monk learns to harness the power of her strikes for the short duration. As a swift action, she can increase the damage of her attacks equal to half her monk level for the round. The monk can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p><h3 id=\"improved-evasion\">Improved Evasion (Ex)</h3><p>At 9th level, a monk’s evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon’s breath weapon, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p><h3 id=\"counterattack\">Counterattack (Ex)</h3><p>At 11th level, a monk gains the ability to counter blows when attacked.</p><p>As a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>, she designates an opponent and once per round, if that opponent attacks her, she can immediately make an attack of opportunity. A helpless monk (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of this ability, nor can she use this ability when flat-footed.</p><h3 id=\"advanced-martial-arts-talent\">Advanced Martial Arts Talent</h3><p class=\"western\">At 12th level, and every two levels thereafter, a monk can choose one of the following advanced martial arts talents in place of a martial arts talent.</p><ul><li>A complete list of advanced martial arts talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/monk/martial-arts-talents/\">Advanced Martial Arts Talents</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"disruption\">Disruption (Su)</h3><p>At 12th level, a monk can spend 1 point from her <em>ki</em> pool as a swift action to add 1d6 points of damage to her unarmed strikes against creatures of either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment for 1 round. This stacks with other abilities that deal damage based on alignment. She cannot alter her alignment choice until the next time she uses this ability.</p><p>Creatures that are of the appropriate alignment and are struck by this attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half of the monk’s level + her Wisdom modifier) or lose any damage reduction based on alignment for a number of rounds equal to the monk’s Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round). A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to having its damage reduction disrupted by that monk for 24 hours. This attack disrupts only alignment components of damage reduction, not any other components; for example, DR/cold iron and good becomes DR/cold iron.</p><h3 id=\"defensive-roll\">Defensive Roll (Ex)</h3><p>At 13th level, a monk may use the <a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-advanced-talents/defensive-roll-ex/\">defensive roll</a> advanced thief talent once per day, plus once per three levels beyond 13th (to a maximum of 3 times a day at 19th level).</p><h3 id=\"prescience\">Prescience (Su)</h3><p>At 14th level, a monk gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and CMD. At 20th level, the bonus increases to +4.</p><h3 id=\"petrifying-strike\">Petrifying Strike (Su)</h3><p>At 15th level, a monk can turn an opponent to stone with a single strike. She can use this ability once per day, and must announce the attempt before making her attack roll. If the monk’s strike is successful, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half of the monk’s level + her Wisdom modifier) or be petrified for 1 hour per monk level. Incorporeal creatures and creatures immune to petrification are unaffected by this ability.</p><h3 id=\"timeless-body\">Timeless Body (Ex)</h3><p>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.</p><h3 id=\"old-master\">Old Master (Ex)</h3><p>At 18th level, the monk has reached the highest levels of his martial arts school. The monk gains one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus when using flurry of blows, and his dodge bonus to AC increases by 2.</p><h3 id=\"improved-counterattack\">Improved Counterattack (Ex)</h3><p>At 19th, the monk’s ability to counter blows when attacked improves. Anytime an opponent attacks the monk, she can make an attack of opportunity. She may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity equal to her Dexterity bonus. She cannot counterattack the same opponent twice. A helpless monk (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of this ability, but can use this ability while flat-footed. This ability does not stack with Combat Reflexes.</p><h3 id=\"perfect-self\">Perfect Self (Ex)</h3><p>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever her original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a non-chaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but she does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. She cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of her maximum.</p><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.

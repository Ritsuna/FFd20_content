the following are class features of the holy knight.</p><h3 id=\"weapon-and-armor-proficiency\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3><p>Holy knights are proficient with all simple, martial weapons, and knight swords and with all armor (light, medium, and heavy) and shields (including tower shields).</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the holy knight receives the Limit Breaks (Brightest Day and Last Bastion).</p><p><em>Brightest Day (Su): </em>This Limit Break causes a bright light to erupt around the holy knight and her allies within 30 feet for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four holy knight levels after 1st. This dispels any concealment granted to any enemies within the area of effect and causes them to be afflicted with the Blind status effect for the duration of the limit break, a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the holy knight’s level + her Charisma modifier) to negate this effect.</p><p><em>Last Bastion (Su):</em> This Limit Break allows the holy knight to use the power of light to protect herself and her allies to reduce harm inflicted. The holy knight and all allies within a 30-ft.-radius of the holy knight take half damage from any source for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four holy knight levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><h3 id=\"oath-stance\">Oath Stance (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the holy knight swore an oath to guard and fight for the weak. As a swift action, she may choose to be under the effects of either Shield Oath or Sword Oath (see below). She cannot be in both oaths at the same time. If she switches to one oath, the other oath immediately ends. If she is sleeping or otherwise unconscious, she leaves the stance. To leave Oath Stance voluntarily, she must use a move action to end it.</p><ul><li><em>Shield Oath (Su):</em> Under this stance, the holy knight gains a +1 (plus an additional +1 for every three levels thereafter) deflection bonus to AC and an insight bonus equal half of her holy knight level to attack rolls. She also gains damage reduction equal to half her holy knight level (rounded down, which stacks with all other damage reduction). However, she receives a -2 penalty (plus an additional -1 for every three levels thereafter) on all damage rolls while under this oath.</li><li><em>Sword Oath (Su):</em> Under this stance, the holy knight gains a +1 (plus an additional +1 for every three levels thereafter) insight bonus to attack rolls and an insight bonus equal to half her holy knight level to damage rolls. She also ignores damage reduction equal to up to half her holy knight level (rounded down). However, she receives a -2 penalty (plus an additional -1 for every three levels thereafter) to her AC while under this oath.</li></ul><h3 id=\"lay-on-hands\">Lay on Hands (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, a holy knight can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to half her holy knight level (minimum 1) plus her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, a holy knight can heal 1d6 hit points of damage, increasing by 1d6 for every two holy knight levels beyond the 1st. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the holy knight targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a holy knight only needs one free hand to use this ability. Alternatively, a holy knight can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of holy damage + 1d6 for every two levels the holy knight possesses after 1st. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.</p><h3 id=\"cover\">Cover (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, the defensive prowess of the holy knight is second to none, allowing her to focus her actions purely on defending herself and her allies in ways that cannot be replicated. When an ally within 10 feet is targeted with a melee or ranged attack, the holy knight may, as an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#immediate\">immediate action</a>, step forward to reposition the ally adjacently to her and forcing the enemy to make the attack roll on the holy knight’s armor class instead. She may move as part of this ability, provided her total movement before her next turn does not exceed her speed (her movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal). She can only intercept physical melee attacks and ranged attacks, such as an incoming arrow or a blow from a sword, not from spells and other effects. The holy knight can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + half of her holy knight level.</p><p>At 5th level, the range of cover increases by 5 feet and increases by an additional 5 feet per five holy knight levels thereafter. Additionally, while using cover, the holy knight adds her Charisma modifier to her AC for the attack.</p><h3 id=\"shared-defense\">Shared Defense (Su)</h3><p>At 2nd level, a holy knight can spend one use of her lay on hands ability as a standard action to grant all adjacent allies (including other holy knights) a bonus. At 2nd level, adjacent allies receive a +1 sacred bonus to their AC and on their saving throws. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the holy knight’s Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 16th level, this bonus increases by +1.</p><p>At 7th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 10 feet, and allies that are at fewer than 0 hit points within this area are automatically stabilized.</p><p>At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are immune to bleed damage.</p><p>At 17th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25% chance to negate any sneak attack or critical hit scored against them. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area.</p><h3 id=\"first-into-battle\">First Into Battle (Su)</h3><p>At 2nd level, a holy knight can spend 1 use of lay on hands to act in the surprise round, even if she is surprised. When the holy knight makes an initiative check, she gains a bonus to the check equal to her Charisma bonus.</p><h3 id=\"divine-arts\">Divine Arts (Su)</h3><p>At 2nd level, arts of divine light slumber within the holy knight. She calls upon this divine power when her allies are in danger. She can only use these arts while under Sword Oath or Shield Oath. The holy knight gains a divine art ability at 2nd level and every two holy knight levels thereafter. The holy knight can use divine art abilities a number of times per day equal to half her holy knight level plus her Charisma modifier.</p><ul><li>A complete list of divine arts can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/holy-knight/divine-arts/\">Divine Arts</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"holy-grace\">Holy Grace (Su)</h3><p>At 3rd level, a holy knight applies her Charisma modifier (if positive) (this bonus is halved if she has a level in another non-prestige class and this is not her favored class) as a bonus on all saving throws. If the character is ever able to add her Charisma modifier to her saves through use of another ability (for example, the dark knight’s dark blessing) she may only add her Charisma modifier once to her saves.</p><h3 id=\"blessing\">Blessing (Su)</h3><p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a holy knight can select one blessing. Each blessing adds an effect to the holy knight’s lay on hands ability. Whenever the holy knight uses lay on hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the blessings possessed by the holy knight.</p><p>At 3rd level, the holy knight can select from the following initial blessings.</p><ul><li><em>Blinded: </em>The target is no longer under the Blind status effect.</li><li><em>Deceived:</em> The target can immediately attempt a new saving throw to disbelieve any ongoing illusions that it failed to disbelieve within the last minute.</li><li><em>Fatigued:</em> The target is no longer fatigued.</li><li><em>Poisoned:</em> The target is no longer under the Poison status effect.</li><li><em>Shaken:</em> The target is no longer under the Shaken status effect.</li><li><em>Sickened:</em> The target is no longer under the Sicken status effect.</li></ul><p>At 6th level, a holy knight adds the following blessings to the list of those that can be selected.</p><ul><li><em>Dazed:</em> The target is no longer under the Daze status effect.</li><li><em>Diseased:</em> The target is no longer under the Disease status effect.</li><li><em>Enfeebled:</em> The holy knight dispels any magical effects that are reducing one of the target’s ability scores (holy knight’s choice)</li><li><em>Imperiled:</em> The target is no longer under the Imperil status effect.</li><li><em>Silenced:</em> The target is no longer under the Silence status effect.</li><li><em>Staggered:</em> The target is no longer staggered, unless the target is at exactly 0 hit points.</li></ul><p>At 9th level, a holy knight adds the following blessings to the list of those that can be selected.</p><ul><li><em>Confused:</em> The target is no longer confused.</li><li><em>Cursed:</em> The target is no longer under the Curse status effect.</li><li><em>Exhausted:</em> The target is no longer exhausted. <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The holy knight must have the fatigue blessing before selecting this blessing.</li><li><em>Frightened:</em> The target is no longer frightened. <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The holy knight must have the shaken blessing before selecting this blessing.</li><li><em>Immobilized: </em>The target is no longer Immobilized.</li><li><em>Injured:</em> The target gains fast healing 3 for a number of rounds equal to half the holy knight’s level.</li><li><em>Nauseated:</em> The target is no longer Nauseated. <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The holy knight must have the sickened blessing before selecting this blessing.</li><li><em>Restorative:</em> The target heals 1d4 points of ability damage from a single ability score of the holy knight’s choosing. <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The holy knight must have the enfeebled blessing before selecting this blessing.</li><li><em>Sapped:</em> The target is no longer under the Sap status effect. <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The holy knight must have the poisoned blessing before selecting this blessing.</li><li><em>Slowed:</em> The target is no longer under the Slow status effect.</li></ul><p>At 12th level, a holy knight adds the following blessings to the list of those that can be selected.</p><ul><li><em>Amputated:</em> The holy knight’s lay on hands also acts as <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/r/regenerate\"><em>regenerate</em></a>, but only for the purposes of regrowing severed body members, broken bones, and ruined organs. <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The holy knight must have the injured blessing before she can select this blessing.</li><li><em>Berserk:</em> The target is no longer under the Berserk status effect.</li><li><em>Deafened:</em> The target is no longer deafened.</li><li><em>Disabled:</em> The target is no longer under the Disable status effect.</li><li><em>Ensorcelled:</em> The holy knight’s lay on hands also acts as <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/dispel\"><em>dispel</em></a>, using the holy knight’s level as her caster level (maximum 20).</li><li><em>Paralyzed:</em> The target is no longer under the Paralyze status effect.</li><li><em>Petrified:</em> The holy knight’s lay on hands ability also acts as <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/s/stona\"><em>stona</em></a>, but only for the purpose of removing the petrified condition from a creature.</li><li><em>Stunned:</em> The target is no longer under the Stun status effect.</li><li><em>Zombie: </em>The target is no longer under the Zombie status effect.</li></ul><p>These abilities are cumulative. Once a status effect or spell effect is chosen, it can’t be changed.</p><h3 id=\"aura-of-excellence\">Aura of Excellence (Su)</h3><p>At 4th level, a holy knight is immune to any effect that would force her reroll a die against her will or roll twice and take the lower result. Whenever an ally within 10 feet of her would reroll a die against her will, she can roll twice and take the higher result. Whenever an ally within 10 feet would be forced to roll twice and take the lower result, she can instead roll three times and take the second-lowest result. This ability functions only while the holy knight is conscious.</p><h3 id=\"spells\">Spells</h3><p>Beginning at 4th level, a holy knight gains the ability to cast holy knight spells, which are drawn from the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells-by-class/holy-knight/\">holy knight spell list</a>. A holy knight begins play with 1 1st level holy knight spell of her choice. Each time a character attains a new holy knight level, she gains one spell of her choice to add to her list of spells. The free spell must be of spell levels she can cast. Like most spellcasters, a holy knight can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to her repertoire. Unlike other spellcasters, a holy knight wearing armor does not affect her spellcasting ability.</p><p>To learn or cast a spell, the holy knight must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a holy knight’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the holy knight’s Charisma modifier. In addition, a holy knight gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Charisma—see <strong>Table: Bonus MP per Day (by Spell Level)</strong> on the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/mp-system/\">MP System page</a>).</p><p>Through 3rd level, a holy knight has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is equal to her holy knight level – 3.</p><h3 id=\"unwavering-confidence\">Unwavering Confidence (Ex)</h3><p>At 5th level, a holy knight draws upon her convictions to sustain her in battle. As a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#move\">move action</a>, she gains a +2 morale bonus to Constitution for a number of rounds equal to 4 + her holy knight level + her Constitution modifier. Hit points gained from an increase in Constitution are not lost like temporary hit points. The morale bonus increases to +4 at 10th level, and to +6 at 15th level. The total number of rounds of unwavering confidence per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive. As a free action, she can turn this ability off to conserve rounds.</p><h3 id=\"divine-health\">Divine Health (Ex)</h3><p>At 7th level, a holy knight gains immunity to Poison, Sap, and Disease status effects as well as normal poisons and diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p><h3 id=\"aura-of-good\">Aura of Good (Su)</h3><p>At 8th level, a holy knight’s weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming Damage Reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of her is treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming Damage Reduction. This ability functions only while the holy knight is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.</p><h3 id=\"flash-of-light\">Flash of Light (Su)</h3><p>At 9th level, a holy knight can channel holy energy into a burst of light within a 10-ft.-radius. All enemies in the area of effect are inflicted with Blind and Shaken status effects, a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the holy knight’s level + her Charisma modifier) is required for each status effect to negate. Every five holy knight levels thereafter, the area of effect increases by 10 feet.</p><p>Using this ability consumes two uses of the holy knight’s lay on hands ability, and the effects last for 3 rounds plus a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (if any).</p><h3 id=\"cleansing-flame\">Cleansing Flame (Su)</h3><p>At 10th level, the holy knight may expend two uses of her lay on hands ability to ignite her weapon with a cleansing blue flame for 1 minute. This flame sheds light as a torch. Evil creatures within 20 feet of the flame take a –4 penalty on attack rolls against her and her allies, and her allies within 20 feet of the flame gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from evil creatures.</p><h3 id=\"aura-of-courage\">Aura of Courage (Su)</h3><p>At 11th level, a holy knight is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the holy knight is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.</p><h3 id=\"aura-of-resolving-hope\">Aura of Resolving Hope (Su)</h3><p>At 13th level, a holy knight is immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm effects. This ability functions only while the holy knight is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.</p><h3 id=\"restore\">Restore (Su)</h3><p>At 14th level, a holy knight can expend two uses of her lay on hands ability to attempt to dispel any non-harmless enfeebling effect on a target, as <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/dispel\">dispel</a>. Additionally, the holy knight can expend two uses of her lay on hands ability to remove all of the target’s temporary Charisma damage and restore all points drained from its Charisma score, as restora.</p><h3 id=\"sentinel\">Sentinel (Ex)</h3><p>At 15th level, the holy knight is capable of turning an otherwise lethal blow and continue the fight. When an attack that inflicts hit point damage from a natural attack, melee weapon, or ranged weapon would reduce the holy knight to 0 or fewer hit points, she can make a Fortitude save (DC the attacker’s attack roll) to deflect the attack to her armor or shield (light, heavy, or tower shields only), causing it to suffer the damage in her place (apply item hardness as normal). If this would break the character’s armor, it gains the broken condition until it is repaired. The holy knight cannot use this ability with broken armor or a broken shield. The holy knight must be wearing armor or a shield to use this ability.</p><h3 id=\"crusader-champion\">Crusader Champion (Su)</h3><p>At 16th level, the holy knight’s zeal is so inspiring that it affects all around her. The ranges of all of the holy knight’s auras increase by 30 feet.</p><h3 id=\"aura-of-healing\">Aura of Healing (Su)</h3><p>At 17th level, a holy knight can expend one use of her lay on hands ability to emit a 30-foot aura of healing for a number of rounds equal to her holy knight level. Allies in this aura (including the holy knight) automatically stabilize if below 0 hit points and are immune to bleed damage. In addition, allies (including the holy knight) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura are healed an amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may make a saving throw against any afflictions they are suffering from, such as a curse, disease, or poison. This saving throw only counts toward curing the affliction and does not impose any penalty on a failed save. Allies can only be healed once by a use of this ability and they can only attempt additional saving throws once per day, even if they are exposed to this aura multiple times.</p><h3 id=\"aura-of-warding\">Aura of Warding (Su)</h3><p>At 19th level, the holy knight becomes immune to magical aging effects and adds her Charisma bonus (if any) as a bonus to her touch AC. Allies within 10 feet of the holy knight add the holy knight’s Charisma bonus as a bonus to touch AC. This bonus cannot make her touch AC go above her normal AC, nor can it make an ally’s touch AC exceed their normal AC. This aura functions only while the holy knight is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.</p><h3 id=\"holy-champion\">Holy Champion (Su)</h3><p>At 20th level, the holy knight becomes the conduit of the divine. Her divine arts and lay on hands always deal the maximum amount possible.</p><h3 id=\"code-of-conduct\">Code of Conduct</h3><p>A holy knight must be of non-evil alignment and cannot level further into this class if she ever shifts to an evil alignment.</p><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have holy knight as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class

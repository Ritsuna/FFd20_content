of the geomancer.</p><h3 id=\"weapon-and-armor-proficiency\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3><p>Geomancers are proficient with the following weapons: battleaxe, club, dagger, dart, longsword, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, shortsword, sling, and spear. Geomancers are also proficient in light armor as well as shields (except tower shields).</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the geomancer receives the Limit Breaks (Elemental Torrent and Geocache).</p><p><em>Elemental Torrent (Su): </em>This Limit Break produces a vertical column of random elements roaring downward upon an area within 60 ft. The area of effect is cylindrical (15-ft.-radius., 40-ft.-high). Enemies within the area of effect take 2d6 points of non-elemental damage + an additional 2d6 per four geomancer levels after 1st, a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the geomancer’s level + her Wisdom modifier) reduces the damage by half. Those who fail the Reflex must make a Fortitude save for each status effect (DC 10 + half of the geomancer’s level + her Wisdom modifier) or be inflicted with Blind, Confuse, Curse, Petrify, Silence, and Slow status for 1 round + 1 round per four geomancer levels after 1st.</p><p><em>Geocache (Su):</em> This Limit Break allows the geomancer to change the terrain to suit her needs. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four geomancer levels after 1st, the geomancer can choose a terrain (under Geomancy) and it converts the terrain around the geomancer in a 30-ft.-radius. The geomancer can change the terrain once per round as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><h3 id=\"spells\">Spells</h3><p>A geomancer casts geomancy spells which are drawn from the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells-by-class/geomancer/\">geomancer spell list</a>. A geomancer begins play with 3 1st level geomancy spells of her choice. The geomancer also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Wisdom modifier to add to her list of spells. Each time a character attains a new geomancer level, she gains two spells of her choice to add to her list of spells. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast. Like most mages, a geomancer can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to her repertoire.</p><p>To learn or cast a spell, the geomancer must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a geomancer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the geomancer’s Wisdom modifier. In addition, a geomancer gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Wisdom—see <strong>Table: Bonus MP per Day (by Spell Level)</strong> on the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/mp-system/\">MP System page</a>).</p><h3 id=\"geomancy\">Geomancy (Su)</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, a geomancer draws upon the power of the terrain she stands upon to defeat her foes.</p><p>The geomancer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her class level + her Wisdom modifier. Which geomancy power a geomancer may use depends upon what type of terrain she is standing on, as noted in the table below. What terrain type the geomancer is standing on is up to the final determination of the DM. The range of geomancy is 25 feet plus 5 feet every two geomancer levels after 1st, and requires a ranged touch attack to strike a target. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 damage (of an elemental type, or 1d4 if non-elemental, see below) plus her Wisdom modifier plus an additional 1d6 (or 1d4 if non-elemental) per three geomancer levels after 1st, centered on the target. Any adjacent creature to the target can make a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the geomancer’s level + her Wisdom modifier) to take half damage.</p><p>Any creatures struck by the effect must make another save (DC 10 + half of the geomancer’s level + her Wisdom modifier). If the creature fails this save it takes a secondary effect based on the attack used. This secondary effect has a duration of 3 rounds. On each round after the first, creatures affected by the secondary effect may attempt a saving throw at the start of their turn to end the secondary effect early. A geomancer’s class level is considered to be her caster level for the purposes of the Geomancy ability.<br></p><h2>Table: Geomancy</h2><table><thead><tr class=\"row-1\"><th>Power</th><th>Terrain</th><th>Special</th><th>Save</th><th>Elemental Damage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"row-2\"><td>Pitfall</td><td>Packed or loose dirt, including roads</td><td>Weighted</td><td>Fort</td><td>Earth</td></tr><tr class=\"row-3\"><td>Water Ball</td><td>Water</td><td>Drenched</td><td>Fort</td><td>Water</td></tr><tr class=\"row-4\"><td>Hell Ivy</td><td>Grasses and other small plant growth</td><td>Entangled</td><td>Reflex</td><td>Non-Elemental</td></tr><tr class=\"row-5\"><td>Carve Model</td><td>Loose rocks or worked stone outdoors</td><td>Silenced</td><td>Will</td><td>Earth</td></tr><tr class=\"row-6\"><td>Local Quake</td><td>Unworked Stone</td><td>Staggered</td><td>Will</td><td>Earth</td></tr><tr class=\"row-7\"><td>Kamaitachi</td><td>Man-made structures not otherwise specified</td><td>Disabled</td><td>Will</td><td>Wind</td></tr><tr class=\"row-8\"><td>Demon Fire</td><td>Worked stone, wooden, and other floors indoors</td><td>Sleep</td><td>Will</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr class=\"row-9\"><td>Quicksand</td><td>Swamp, deep mud, and marshland</td><td>Immobilized</td><td>Will</td><td>Water</td></tr><tr class=\"row-10\"><td>Sand Storm</td><td>Sandy ground</td><td>Blinded</td><td>Fort</td><td>Wind</td></tr><tr class=\"row-11\"><td>Blizzard</td><td>Snow, ice, and cold tundra</td><td>Frozen</td><td>Fort</td><td>Ice</td></tr><tr class=\"row-12\"><td>Gusty Wind</td><td>Flying or standing at the very edge of a high place</td><td>Squalled</td><td>Reflex</td><td>Wind</td></tr><tr class=\"row-13\"><td>Lava Ball</td><td>Lava or fire</td><td>Burning</td><td>Reflex</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr class=\"row-14\"><td>Short Circuit</td><td>Large Machines or mechanical structures</td><td>Static</td><td>Will</td><td>Lightning</td></tr><tr class=\"row-15\"><td>Leaf Fall</td><td>Large plant growth: forest, tree canopy</td><td>Nauseated</td><td>Fort</td><td>Non-Elemental</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3 id=\"spell-proficiency\">Spell Proficiency (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">Geomancers are considered to have the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat/\">Precise Shot</a> feat while casting spells, using class features that require ranged touch or using any magical items that require ranged touch.</p><h3 id=\"nature-sense\">Nature Sense (Ex)</h3><p>A geomancer gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p><h3 id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips</h3><p>Geomancers learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. Geomancers begin with 4 0-level spells and gain an additional 0-level spell every three levels after 1st level.</p><h3 id=\"ley-lines\">Ley Lines (Su)</h3><p>At 2nd level, the geomancer learns to create magical connections with a specific type of terrain. Choose one of the following terrain types: aquatic, desert, forest, hills, marsh, mountains, or plains. In that terrain, the geomancer’s effective caster level for all spells increases by +1. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the character may either choose a new terrain in which to receive the benefit (at +1), or increase her effective caster level in a previously chosen terrain by an additional +1.</p><h3 id=\"elemental-resistance\">Elemental Resistance (Ex)</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, the geomancer gains an elemental resistance of 2 to earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, and wind. This resistance increases by 2 every four geomancer levels after 2nd level.</p><h3 id=\"eyes-of-the-storm\">Eyes of the Storm (Ex)</h3><p>At 2nd level, a geomancer can see through 10 feet of magical fog, mist, gas, wind, rain, or similar inclement weather conditions, ignoring any concealment it might grant. This distance increases by 5 feet for every four geomancer levels beyond 2nd.</p><h3 id=\"geomancy-tricks\">Geomancy Tricks</h3><p class=\"western\">As a geomancer gains experience, she learns a number of tricks that aid her. Starting at 2nd level, the geomancer gains one geomancy trick. She gains an additional geomancy trick for every two levels of geomancer attained after 2nd level. Unless specified otherwise, a geomancer cannot select an individual trick more than once.</p><ul><li>A complete list of geomancy tricks can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/geomancer/geomancy-tricks/\">Geomancy Tricks</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"favored-terrain\">Favored Terrain (Ex)</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, a geomancer may select a type of terrain from <strong>Table: Favored Terrains</strong>. The geomancer gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when she is in this terrain. A geomancer traveling through her favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though she may leave a trail if she so chooses).</p><p>At 7th level and every four levels thereafter, the geomancer may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p><p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the geomancer’s bonuses do not stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p><h2>Table: Favored Terrains</h2><table><thead><tr class=\"row-1\"><th>Favored Terrains</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"row-2\"><td>Cold (ice, glaciers, snow, and tundra)</td></tr><tr class=\"row-3\"><td>Desert (sand and wastelands)</td></tr><tr class=\"row-4\"><td>Forest (coniferous and deciduous)</td></tr><tr class=\"row-5\"><td>Jungle</td></tr><tr class=\"row-6\"><td>Mountain (including hills)</td></tr><tr class=\"row-7\"><td>Plains</td></tr><tr class=\"row-8\"><td>Planes (pick one, other than Material Plane)</td></tr><tr class=\"row-9\"><td>Swamp</td></tr><tr class=\"row-10\"><td>Underground (caves and dungeons)</td></tr><tr class=\"row-11\"><td>Urban (buildings, streets, and sewers)</td></tr><tr class=\"row-12\"><td>Water (above and below the surface)</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><div class=\"flex-container\"><div><h3 id=\"armored-mage\">Armored Mage (Ex)</h3><p>At 3rd level, normally, armor of any kind interferes with a spell-caster’s gestures, which can cause spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A geomancer’s limited focus and specialized training, however, allows her to avoid spell failure so long as she sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium armor or heavy shields. This ability does not apply to spells gained from a different spell-casting class.</p><h3 id=\"homefield-advantage\">Homefield Advantage (Su)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 4th level, a geomancer has learned to access her favored terrain, wherever she may be. Once per day, as a swift action, she may treat the area within a 30-ft radius burst centered on her as one of her favored terrain (chosen upon activation). This ability lasts for 1 round per geomancer level. She gains an additional use of this ability at 8th, 12th, 16th and 20th level.</p><p class=\"western\">At 8th level, a geomancer’s homefield advantage radius increases by 10-ft.</p><p class=\"western\">At 12th level, the homefield advantage’s radius increases by another 10-ft.

Each movement power can be used as a swift action, and lasts for a duration of 1 round per geomancer level. The geomancer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom’s modifier.</p><ul><li><strong>Burrow:</strong> A geomancer can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock. A geomancer cannot charge or run while burrowing. Geomancers can burrow at a speed of 10 feet + 10 feet per four geomancer levels after 4th.</li><li><strong>Climb:</strong> A geomancer has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The geomancer must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but she can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. The geomancer climbs at the given speed while climbing. If she chooses an accelerated climb, she moves at double the given climb speed and makes a single Climb check at a –5 penalty. A geomancer cannot run while climbing. She retains her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against a geomancer. Geomancers can climb at a speed of 10 feet + 10 feet per four geomancer levels after 4th.</li><li><strong>Float:</strong> A geomancer can traverse any terrain that would normally impede movement (water, lava, ice, etc.) without any problems. A geomancer floats 5 feet off the ground and gently floats downward if off the ground more than 5 feet. Geomancers moves at half her own base land speed while floating.</li><li><strong>Fly:</strong> A geomancer can move through the air at the indicated speed if carrying no more than a light load. Geomancers has a +8 racial bonus on all Fly checks and can fly (perfect) at a speed of 20 feet + 20 feet per four geomancer levels after 4th.</li><li><strong>Swim:</strong> A geomancer can move through water at its swim speed without making Swim checks. She has a +8 circumstance bonus on any Swim checks to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. The geomancer can always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. She can use the run action while swimming, provided she swims in a straight line. Geomancers can swim at a speed of 10 feet + 10 feet per four geomancer levels after 4th.</li></ul><h3 id=\"clear-mind\">Clear Mind (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 5th level, a geomancer can regain her MP quicker. The geomancer must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. For example, she could be riding in the back of a carriage and benefit from this ability. The geomancer does not gain this recovery if she is asleep or unconscious. The geomancer regains 1 MP per hour. This increases by 1 for every five geomancer levels after 5th.</p><h3 id=\"geosynchronous\">Geosynchronous (Su)</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, while in any favored terrain that the geomancer has chosen, she gains a +1 insight bonus to attack rolls and saving throws against creatures and a +1 insight bonus to all skill checks used in that terrain. These bonuses last as long as she remains in the specific location. These bonuses increase by +1 at every five levels gained after 5th.</p><h3 id=\"endure-elements\">Endure Elements (Su)</h3><p>As per the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/e/endure-elements/\"><em>Endure Elements</em></a> spell, a geomancer of 5th level is constantly protected against extremes of temperature.</p><h3 id=\"natures-armor\">Nature’s Armor (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 8th level, a geomancer learns to use the natural cover her favored terrain provides. Whenever she is on one of her favored terrains, a geomancer receives a +2 natural bonus to AC. This bonus increases by 1 at 12th, 16th and 20th level.</p><h3 id=\"natures-resilience\">Nature’s Resilience (Su)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 9th level, whenever a geomancer is on one of her favored terrains, she gains a bonus equal to her favored terrain bonus on all saves against extraordinary, spell-like and supernatural abilities.</p><h3 id=\"the-earth-speaks\">The Earth Speaks (Su)</h3><p>Starting at 9th level, a geomancer benefits from Tremorsense out to 30 feet in any favored terrain she has chosen. The geomancer automatically senses the location of anything that is in contact with the ground and within range. If her favored terrain is water, she can also sense the location of creatures moving through water. If no straight path exists through the ground from the geomancer to those she is sensing, then the range defines the maximum distance of the shortest indirect path. She must herself be in contact with the ground, and the creatures must be moving. As long as the other creatures are taking physical actions, including casting spells, they’re considered moving; they don’t have to move from place to place for the geomancer to detect them.</p><h3 id=\"timeless-body\">Timeless Body (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">After attaining 11th level, a geomancer no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the geomancer still dies of old age when her time is up.</p><h3 id=\"the-air-sings\">The Air Sings (Su)</h3><p>Starting at 13th level, a geomancer benefits from Blindsense out to 30 feet while in any favored terrain she has chosen. Blindsense lets the geomancer notice things it cannot see, but without the precision of blindsight. The geomancer with blindsense usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the geomancer cannot see has total concealment (50% miss chance) against her, and she still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of the geomancer. The geomancer is still denied her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures she cannot see.</p><h3 id=\"storm-lord\">Storm Lord (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 13th level, a geomancer is unaffected by natural and magical wind effects (such as the squall status effect). She also becomes immune to deafness and gains +2 bonus on saving throws against wind spells.</p><h3 id=\"tongue-of-the-sun-and-moon\">Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex)</h3><p class=\"western\">At 17th level, a geomancer can speak with any living creature.</p><h3 id=\"the-echoes-dance\">The Echoes Dance (Su)</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, a geomancer benefits from Blindsight out to 30 feet while in any favored terrain she has chosen. This ability makes invisibility and concealment (even magical darkness) irrelevant to the geomancer (though she still can’t see ethereal creatures and must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object).</p><ul><li>Blindsight never allows a geomancer to distinguish color or visual contrast. She cannot read with blindsight.</li><li>Blindsight does not subject a geomancer to gaze attacks (even though darkvision does).</li><li>Blinding attacks do not penalize a geomancer using her blindsight.</li><li>Deafening attacks thwart a geomancer’s blindsight.</li><li>Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.</li><li>Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.</li></ul><h3 id=\"planar-acclimation\">Planar Acclimation (Ex)</h3><p>After attaining 19th level, a geomancer gains great power and manifests a portion of the raw energy of the universe with themselves. As such, they gain great power depending on which elemental plane of existence they choose. Whichever plane they choose, they become completely immune to all of the negative effects of the plane as if they were native to that plane and any spells that would be dampened because of the plane (Water spells in the Fire plane), are cast as normal spells by the geomancer. This ability can be switched, altering which plane the geomancer is acclimated to, every day, but it cannot be changed after she makes her decision for the day.</p><h3 id=\"earthen-ascension\">Earthen Ascension (Su)</h3><p>Also at 20th level, the geomancer transcends her mortal form. She is now considered an outsider and is immune to bleed, paralysis, poison, sleep effects and stunning. The geomancer is no longer subject to critical hits or flanking. Further, the geomancer no longer ages and removes any age related penalties she currently has.</p><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have geomancer as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/aegyl/\"><strong>Aegyl</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add +1/2 to wind spell or spell-like ability damage.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/dwarf/\"><strong>Dwarf</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add +1/2 to earth spell or spell-like ability damage.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/elvaan/\"><strong>Elvaan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add +1/2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) skill checks.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/galka/\"><strong>Galka</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add a +1/5 bonus on elemental resistance.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/beastman-tribes/gnath/\"><strong>Gnath</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add +1/2 to the bonus on initiative checks the geomancer gains based on favored terrain.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/gria/\"><strong>Gria</strong></a>: Add +1/4 to the number of times the geomancer can use the Geomancy ability.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/half-breed/\"><strong>Half-Breed</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add one spell known from the geomancer spell list.

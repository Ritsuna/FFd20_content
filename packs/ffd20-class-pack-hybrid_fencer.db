Fencers dart in and out of the fray, wearing down opponents with lunges and feints, all while foiling the powerful attacks against them with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade. Their deft parries and fatal ripostes are carnage elevated to an art form. Some may be arrogant and devil-may-care, but behind this veneer lie people deeply dedicated to their craft. Those of smaller races are particularly driven to prove that the right mix of discipline and daring is the perfect counter to size and strength, and enjoy nothing more than taking down lumbering brutes and bullies.</em></p><p><strong>Role:</strong> The fencer focuses on quick, nimble feet and a good eye at striking with a light, one handed weapon. Often referred to as “swashbucklers”, fencers use their speed and coordination in a deadly blend with their Charisma to become capable fighters who prefer to avoid getting hit instead of drawing upon their resilience to take the blows and keep on standing. With their abilities, they are able to inflict status effects upon their foes.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any</p><p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d10</p><p><strong>Parent Classes:</strong> Warrior and Thief.</p><p><strong>Starting Wealth:</strong> 5d6 × 10 gil (average 175 gil.)

following are class features of the fencer.</p><h3 id=\"weapon-and-armor-proficiency\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3><p>Fencers are proficient with all (simple and martial) light and one-handed piercing weapons. Fencers are also proficient with light armor but no shields.</p><h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3><p>At 1st level, the fencer receives the Limit Breaks (Hummingstrike and Nighthawk).</p><p><em>Hummingstrike (Su):</em> This Limit Break allows the fencer to make an attack roll against all creatures within reach. Creatures that are hit by this attack take damage as normal and must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the fencer’s level + her Charisma modifier) or be inflicted with the <em>Blind</em>, <em>Immobilized</em> and <em>Sap</em> status effects for a number of rounds equal to half of the fencer’s level.</p><p><em>Nighthawk (Su):</em> This Limit Break allows the fencer to counterattack and dodge enemies’ attacks. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four fencer levels after 1st, the fencer automatically dodges an enemy’s melee attack and may counterattack using the fencer’s highest base attack bonus (if within range). The fencer may do this once per round + one additional time per four fencer levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><h3 id=\"duelist-stance\">Duelist Stance (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, a fencer gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC as long as she is wearing no armor or light armor, wields a piercing melee weapon in one hand, and her other hand is empty. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels the fencer possesses to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p><h3 id=\"fencer-weapon-training\">Fencer Weapon Training (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, a fencer selects one fighter weapon group. She gains the benefits of the <a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-finesse-combat\">Weapon Finesse</a> feat with all light and finesseable, one-handed piercing melee weapons from this weapon group. This ability counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for purposes of meeting feat prerequisite and she can use her Charisma score in place of Intelligence as a prerequisite for combat feats.</p><p>At 5th level, she gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with all light and finesseable, one-handed piercing melee weapons plus an additional +1 bonus for every four fencer levels after 5th. At 9th level, she gains the benefits of the Improved Critical feat. A fencer also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with all light and finesseable, one-handed piercing melee weapons. This bonus also applies to the fencer’s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group. If she is using her duelist stance, this attack and damage bonus increases by 2.</p><h3 id=\"einhander\"><strong>Einhander </strong>(Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, the fencer excels at wielding a one-handed weapon while carrying nothing in her off-hand. If she is fighting with a one-handed or light piercing weapon and carrying nothing in her off-hand, she is granted access to five special tactical maneuvers.</p><ul><li><em>Narrow Profile:</em> The fencer can tuck her arm behind her back and offer a narrow profile when she concentrates on defense rather than offense. She gains an additional +2 dodge bonus to AC + an additional +1 dodge bonus to AC per four fencer levels after 1st when fighting defensively or using the total defense action.</li><li><em>Off-Hand Balance:</em> The fencer uses her off hand to balance herself while performing acrobatic maneuvers. After she successfully strikes an opponent, she gains a +2 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to tumble + an additional +2 per four fencer levels after 1st to avoid attacks of opportunity until the start of her next turn. When she flips and rolls out of harm’s way, she uses one hand to keep her balance and her other hand to keep her weapon trained on her foe.</li><li><em>Off-Hand Swap:</em> With a flourish, the fencer flips her weapon into the air, catches it in her off hand, and continues to press the attack. When she uses this maneuver, she must first take a full-attack action to strike an opponent. On her next turn, she can make a special feint as a free action. Her opponent uses the standard rules for resisting a feint. Once she uses this maneuver against a particular opponent, whether it succeeds or fails, she cannot use it against them again. The fencer gains a +2 competence bonus to Bluff skill checks plus an additional +2 per four fencer levels after 1st.</li><li><em>Parry and Riposte: Once per round, w</em>hen an opponent makes a melee attack against the fencer, she can expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack. The fencer makes an attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the fencer, the fencer takes a –2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature’s result, the creature’s attack automatically misses. The fencer must declare the use of this maneuver after the creature’s attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made. Upon performing a successful parry, the fencer can, as an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#immediate\">immediate action</a>, make an attack against the creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her reach. Every four fencer levels after 1st, the fencer can use this maneuver an additional time a round by expending an attack of opportunity.</li><li><em>Precision Strike:</em> A fencer gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing weapon (though not natural weapon attacks), adding her fencer level to the damage dealt. To use this maneuver, a fencer cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield other than a buckler. She can even use this with thrown light or one-handed piercing weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precision strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precision strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn’t multiplied on a critical hit.</li></ul><h3 id=\"lunge-techniques\">Lunge Techniques</h3><p>These techniques utilize the fast strikes of a fencer’s weapon. At 2nd level and every two fencer levels thereafter, the fencer may choose to learn one of the following techniques.</p><ul><li>A complete list of lunge techniques can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/fencer/lunge-techniques/\">Lunge Techniques</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"deflect-arrows\">Deflect Arrows</h3><p>At 2nd level, a fencer gains the benefit of the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/deflect-arrows-combat/\">Deflect Arrows</a> feat when using a light or one-handed piercing weapon. The fencer does not need a free hand to use this feat. If the fencer already has this feat, she may pick another Combat feat for which she meets the prerequisites for.</p><h3 id=\"evasion\">Evasion (Ex)</h3><p>At 2nd level and higher, a fencer can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the fencer is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless fencer does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p><h3 id=\"finesse-training\">Finesse Training (Ex)</h3><p>Beginning at 3rd level, a fencer selects one type of light or finesseable, one-handed piercing melee weapons that she has selected with fencer weapon training and that she is proficient with. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack or ranged attack (if the weapon is a thrown weapon) with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll (this bonus is halved if she has a level in another non-prestige class and this is not her favored class). If any effect would prevent the fencer from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The fencer can select an additional weapon at 7th level and every four fencer levels thereafter, to a maximum of five weapons at 19th level.</p><h3 id=\"elaborate-parry\">Elaborate Parry (Ex)</h3><p>At 3rd level, a fencer gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC while wielding a light or one-handed piercing weapon. Anything that causes the fencer to be disarmed also causes her to lose this deflection bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level).</p><h3 id=\"charmed-life\"><strong>Charmed Life (Ex)</strong></h3><p>At 3rd level, the fencer gains a knack for getting out of trouble. Three times per day as an immediate action before attempting a saving throw, she can add her Charisma modifier to the result of the save. She must choose to do this before the roll is made. At 7th level and every four fencer levels thereafter, the number of times she can do this per day increases by one (to a maximum of 7 times per day at 19th level).</p><h3 id=\"precise-strike\">Precise Strike (Ex)</h3><p>At 4th level, the fencer learns how to make a precise strike, dealing extra damage. The fencer’s attack deals extra damage (called “precision damage”) anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the fencer flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 every three fencer levels thereafter. Should the fencer score a critical hit with a precise strike, this extra damage is not multiplied. A fencer may only use precise strike with light or finesseable, one-handed piercing melee weapons that she has selected with fencer weapon training and that she is proficient with. This stacks with the thief’s sneak attack and similar abilities.</p><h3 id=\"masterful-feint\">Masterful Feint (Ex)</h3><p>At 5th level, a fencer can feint as a swift action instead of a standard action. Additionally, when a fencer successfully feints an opponent, that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against all attacks that she makes until the start of her next turn.</p><h3 id=\"uncanny-dodge\">Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, a fencer can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A fencer with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her. If a fencer already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p><h3 id=\"mobility\">Mobility (Ex)</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, the fencer gains <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/mobility-combat-final/\">Mobility</a> as a bonus feat when wearing light or no armor. If the fencer already has this feat, she may pick another Combat feat for which she meets the prerequisites for.</p><h3 id=\"fleet-footed\">Fleet-Footed (Ex)</h3><p>At 8th level, the fencer’s speed increases by 10 feet. She can take 20 on an Acrobatics check once per day for every four fencer levels she possesses.</p><h3 id=\"extended-reach\">Extended Reach (Ex)</h3><p>The reach of a light or one-handed piercing weapon in the hands of a 9th level or higher fencer is increased by 5 ft., but only on the fencer’s turn.</p><h3 id=\"elaborate-defense\">Elaborate Defense (Ex)</h3><p>At 9th level and higher, if a fencer chooses to fight defensively or use total defense in melee combat, she gains an additional +1 dodge bonus to AC for every three levels of fencer she has attained.</p><h3 id=\"improved-uncanny-dodge\">Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3><p>A fencer of 10th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense denies an opponent the ability to sneak attack the fencer by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more thief levels than the target has fencer levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum thief level required to flank the character.</p><h3 id=\"subtle-blade\"><strong>Subtle Blade (Ex)</strong></h3><p>At 11th level, the fencer is immune to disarm, steal, and sunder combat maneuvers made against a light or one-handed piercing weapon she is wielding.</p><h3 id=\"counterattack\">Counterattack (Ex)</h3><p>At 12th level, a fencer can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who hits the fencer with a melee attack, so long as the attacking creature is within the fencer’s reach.</p><h3 id=\"lightning-strike\">Lightning Strike (Ex)</h3><p>At 13th level, as part of a full attack, a fencer can make one additional attack. This attack is at the fencer’s highest base attack bonus, but each attack in the round (including the extra one) takes a –2 penalty.</p><h3 id=\"science-of-the-blade\">Science of the Blade (Ex)</h3><p>At 14th level, a fencer is able to apply her specialized knowledge of anatomy and physiology to her bladework. The fencer can make a dirty trick, disarm, or trip combat maneuver as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a> with any successful attack using any one-handed piercing weapon. The fencer still provokes attacks of opportunities when using these combat maneuvers if she does not have the appropriate feats to prevent it.</p><h3 id=\"superior-reach\">Superior Reach (Ex)</h3><p>The reach of a light or one-handed piercing weapon in the hands of a 15th level or higher fencer is increased by an additional 5 ft., but only on the fencer’s turn.</p><h3 id=\"no-retreat\">No Retreat (Ex)</h3><p>At 17th level, enemies adjacent to the fencer that take a withdraw action provoke an attack of opportunity from the fencer.</p><h3 id=\"surgical-strike\">Surgical Strike (Ex)</h3><p>At 17th level, when a fencer confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, she deals ability damage in addition to the normal bonus damage from the critical hit. The fencer chooses which ability is damaged, and deals an amount of damage equal to the critical multiplier of the wielded weapon.</p><h3 id=\"incredible-luck\"><strong>Incredible Luck (Ex)</strong></h3><p>At 18th level, the fencer has had so many close calls that she barely notices them anymore. She gains three additional uses of charmed life and can activate the ability as a free action, even outside of her turn.</p><h3 id=\"fencer-weapon-mastery\">Fencer Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h3><p>At 20th level, when a fencer threatens a critical hit with a melee weapon or thrown weapons that belongs to a fighter weapon group that she selected with fencer weapon training, that critical hit is automatically confirmed. Furthermore, the critical multipliers of such weapons increase by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, and so on).</p><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.

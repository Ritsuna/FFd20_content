This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><p><em>Omnistrike (Su): </em>This Limit Break hones the warrior’s speed, increasing his number of attacks. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four warrior levels after 1st, during a full-attack with his chosen weapon, the warrior can make 1 additional attack at his highest BAB, another at -5 at 6th level, another at -10 at 11th level, and one last one at -15 at 16th level. These attacks are not doubled by any other effect but otherwise stack with haste and similar effects. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p><h3 id=\"fighter-training\">Fighter Training</h3><p>At 1st level, a warrior counts his warrior levels as fighter levels for all feat purposes.</p><h3 id=\"chosen-weapon\">Chosen Weapon (Ex)</h3><p>At 1st level, a warrior chooses one of the following weapon groups as his chosen weapons.

This effect lasts for 1 minute. The warrior must meet all the feat’s prerequisites. He may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + half his warrior level.

If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat’s daily limit.</p><p>At 6th level, a warrior can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time.

He may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that he cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another’s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward his daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 10th level, a warrior can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time.

He may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward his daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 12th level, a warrior can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#immediate\">immediate action</a> or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward his daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 20th level, a warrior can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action.

The amount of damage that may be converted increases to 2 points of damage at 10th level, 3 points of damage at 14th level, and 4 points of damage at 18th level. This damage conversion has no effect on bleed damage or damage that is already nonlethal.</p><h3 id=\"additional-techs-iii\"><strong>Additional Techs III (</strong><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#extraordinary\"><strong>Ex</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h3><p>At 7th level, the warrior can make use of the following warrior techniques:</p><ul><li><strong>Backswing (Ex):</strong> The warrior can initiate a backswing attack, as part of a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#full-round\">full-round action</a>, at the cost of 2 stamina. The warrior makes a full-attack with a weapon from his chosen weapon group, and adds double his Strength bonus on damage rolls for all attacks after the first with a two-handed weapon, 1 1/2 times his Strength bonus with a one-handed weapon, and full Strength bonus on all off-handed attacks. This ability doesn’t stack with any other ability that applies a different ability score (or ability score as a different type) to damage, nor abilities that alter the calculation of your Strength bonus on damage.</li><li><strong>Beatdown (</strong><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#extraordinary\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\"><strong>Ex</strong></a><strong>):</strong> The warrior puts his full force behind a single attack, or one made within a full-attack, as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#swift\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">swift action</a> that costs 1 stamina.

At 15th level, he instead reduces the penalty by 4. Even if this reduces the penalty to 0, the warrior doesn’t count as being proficient with these weapons.</p><h3 id=\"secure-weaponry\">Secure Weaponry (Ex)</h3><p>At 8th level, a warrior defensively counters when an opponent uses an effect which would harm his held weapon or cause him to drop it. If the effect is a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability which doesn’t grant the warrior or his weapon a saving throw, the warrior gains a Reflex save to negate the effect, calculating the DC as if the effect did allow a save. Otherwise, if the effect is an extraordinary or non-magical ability that doesn’t require the opponent to succeed at a check against the warrior’s CMD (such as the fencer’s precise strike ability) then the opponent must succeed at a combat maneuver check against the warrior as if attempting a disarm, steal, or sunder combat maneuver, as appropriate for the effect, or the effect is negated.</p><h3 id=\"additional-techs-iv\"><strong>Additional Techs IV (</strong><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#extraordinary\"><strong>Ex</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h3><p>At 9th level, the warrior can make use of the following warrior techniques:</p><ul><li><strong>Rapid Attack (Ex):</strong> As a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#full-round\">full-round action</a>, a warrior can combine a full-attack with a single move at the cost of 2 stamina. He must forgo an attack at his highest bonus but may take the remaining attacks at any point during his movement. In addition, a warrior that dual-wields or uses a double weapon also must forgo the first off-hand attack he can make. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. This cannot be combined with backswing.</li><li><strong>Wild Swing (</strong><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#extraordinary\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\"><strong>Ex</strong></a><strong>):</strong> By spending 1 stamina as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#standard\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">standard action</a>, the warrior makes a single attack against an enemy in the front, back, and sides, creating a cross on the board.</li></ul><h3 id=\"tenacious-grip\">Tenacious Grip (Ex)</h3><p>At 9th level, a warrior doesn’t drop held weapons when panicked or stunned. If the warrior gains the ability to retain his weapons when panicked or stunned from another source, then he also gains the autonomic grasp class feature (see below) and gains the weapon unity class feature at 11th level (instead of 13th).</p><h3 id=\"war-cry\">War Cry (Ex)</h3><p>At 10th level, as a swift action, a warrior can give a war cry to his allies, inspiring them to fight better. This is a warrior technique that requires 1 stamina.</p><p>His allies (the warrior is unaffected) that can hear him gains a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, +2 morale bonus on saving throws, and a +2 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for 1 round per two warrior class levels.</p><h3 id=\"aggressor\"><strong>Aggressor (</strong><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#extraordinary\"><strong>Ex</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h3><p>At 11th level, the warrior is able to leave himself open to attack to allow for a better angle at attacking his foes. As a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>, the warrior may reduce his AC by an amount up to his Constitution modifier, adding this as a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance</a> bonus to his attack rolls. This penalty and bonus last until the beginning of his next turn.</p><h3 id=\"autonomic-grasp\">Autonomic Grasp (Ex)</h3><p>At 11th level, a warrior clings to his weaponry even when on the brink of death. A warrior can choose to retain his hold on his wielded weapons when he is knocked unconscious or succumbs to a sleep effect. While the warrior is asleep or unconscious, attackers must succeed at combat maneuver checks to disarm him, but he gains relevant bonuses for attacking a helpless target, including treating the warrior’s Dexterity as 0 when determining his CMD.</p><h3 id=\"warrior-advanced-talents\">Warrior Advanced Talents</h3><p>At 12th level, and every two levels thereafter, a warrior can choose one of the following warrior advanced talents in place of a warrior talent.</p><ul><li>A complete list of advanced warrior talents can be found here: <a href=\"http://finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/warrior/warrior-talents/#warrior-advanced-talents\">Warrior Advanced Talents</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"improved-rush\"><strong>Improved Rush (</strong><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#extraordinary\"><strong>Ex</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h3><p>At 13th level, the warrior may use his Rush warrior technique as a standard action<strong>.</strong></p><h3 id=\"weapon-unity\">Weapon Unity (Ex)</h3><p>At 13th level, a warrior’s preferred weapons become almost an extension of his body. A warrior is immune to steal and sunder combat maneuvers made against a weapon he is wielding, provided the warrior has Weapon Focus with the weapon or the weapon belongs to weapon group which he possesses. A helpless warrior does not gain the benefits of this ability.</p><h3 id=\"unstoppable-strike\">Unstoppable Strike (Ex)</h3><p>At 15th level, a warrior can take a standard action to make one attack with a weapon from his chosen weapon group as a touch attack that ignores damage reduction (or hardness, if attacking an object).</p><h3 id=\"combat-composure\">Combat Composure (Ex)</h3><p>At 15th level, a warrior can take 10 on skill checks during combat even if the situation or immediate danger wouldn’t normally allow him to do so, provided the skill is a class skill, he is trained in the skill, and he could take 10 on the check outside of combat. The warrior cannot use this ability if he currently has any of the following conditions: confused, cowering, dazed, disabled, exhausted, fascinated, fatigued, flat-footed, frightened, helpless, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned.</p><h3 id=\"devastating-blow\">Devastating Blow (Ex)</h3><p>At 17th level, as a standard action, a warrior may make a single melee attack with a weapon from his chosen weapon group at a –5 penalty. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical hit and deals double damage.</p><h3 id=\"flawless-technique\">Flawless Technique (Ex)</h3><p>At 17th level, a warrior doesn’t automatically miss an attack roll when he rolls a natural 1.</p><h3 id=\"assured-strike\">Assured Strike (Ex)</h3><p>At 19th level, once per round before making an attack roll as a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#free\">free action</a>, a warrior can choose to treat the d20 result as a 10.</p><h3 id=\"doublestrike\">Doublestrike (Ex)</h3><p>At 19th level, once per day, a warrior can spend a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#full-round\">full-round action</a> to make a full attack with double his normal number of attacks. He must declare his opponent beforehand and cannot switch targets while he executes his Doublestrike ability. Doublestrike doesn’t double extra attacks gain through <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/h/haste/\"><em>haste</em></a> or any other similar effects that grants additional attacks nor does it stack with any other class feature that doubles a number of attacks.</p><h3 id=\"weapon-mastery\">Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h3><p>At 20th level, the warrior has mastered his chosen weapon group. Any attacks made with his chosen weapon group automatically confirm all critical threats and have his critical hit threat range increased by 2. This stacks with Improved Critical and similar abilities, but is calculated after all other modifiers. In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon from his chosen weapon group.</p><h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2><p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever he gains a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon his favored classes.

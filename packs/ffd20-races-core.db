They currently share the city of Windurst with the Taru-<wbr />Taru, and most notably the ranks of the Star Sybil&rsquo;s Sybil Guards are drawn exclusively from the Mithra. While Mithra, like most races, exist as both male and female, male births are exceedingly rare, and as such male mithra are normally kept locked away from the prying eyes of other races, the threats of the world, and indeed other mithra. Thus, male adventuring mithra are so rare as to be unheard of. Mithra are known for their energy and curiosity, and of course for their good-<wbr />humored mischievous nature. However, they have a very short attention span so they are not keenly studious like the Tarutaru and nor are they totally tilted towards exercise like the Galka. This definite balance makes them good all round characters that can do particularly well in all fields but still never be the best as Mages or Fighters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/mithra/\">View Mithra on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">15 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(16 &ndash; 19 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 years<br />(16 &ndash; 21 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d6 years<br />(17 &ndash; 27 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive&nbsp;includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li>Self-Taught&nbsp;includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li>Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">35 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">53</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">70</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d20<br />(72 - 110 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 9 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d6 in.<br />(4 ft. 11 in. &ndash; 5 ft. 9 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">120 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d6x2 lbs.)<br />(133 &ndash; 160 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 4 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d4 in.<br />(4 ft. 6 in. &ndash; 5 ft. 2 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">90 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d4x2 lbs.)<br />(103 &ndash; 130 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;Mithra are sociable and agile, but often lack common sense. They gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, and &ndash;2 Wisdom.</li>\n<li>Type:&nbsp;Mithra are humanoids with the mithra subtype.</li>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Mithra are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Base Speed:&nbsp;Mithra have a base speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages:&nbsp;Mithra begin play speaking Common and Mithran. Mithra with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Elvaan, Lupin, Goblin, Lalafellan, Orc, and Vieran.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cat&rsquo;s Luck (Ex):&nbsp;Once per day, when a mithra makes a Reflex saving throw, she can roll the saving throw twice and take the better result. She must decide to use this ability before the saving throw is attempted.</li>\n<li>Lesser Defensive Training:&nbsp;With their peaceful life being threatened by the yagudo, mithra tend to be more cautious around them. Mithra gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC against yagudo.</li>\n<li>Nimble Faller:&nbsp;Mithra have an amazing sense of balance and keen knowledge of their own center of gravity. Mithra land on their feet even when they take lethal damage from a fall and take damage as if the fall were 10 feet shorter than it actually is. Furthermore, mithra gain a +1 bonus to their CMD against trip maneuvers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fleet-Footed:&nbsp;Mithra receive Run as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks.</li>\n<li>Natural Hunter:&nbsp;Mithra receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Movement Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sprinter:&nbsp;Mithra gain a 10-<wbr />foot racial bonus to their speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;Mithra have low-<wbr />light vision allowing them to see twice as far as humes in dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cat&rsquo;s Claws:&nbsp;Some mithra have stronger and more developed claws than other members of their race, and can use them to make attacks. Mithra with this racial trait have a pair of claws they can use as natural weapons. These claws are primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage. This racial trait replaces natural hunter.</li>\n<li>Clever Cat:&nbsp;Mithra&rsquo;s generally friendly disposition doesn&rsquo;t preclude craftiness. Some of them see social obstacles as games to be played and won. These mithra receive a +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks. This racial trait replaces natural hunter.</li>\n<li>Climber:&nbsp;Mithra hunters excel at hunting prey from trees and other high vantage points. Mithra with this racial trait possess a climb speed of 20 feet (along with the +8 racial bonus on Climb checks a climb speed affords). This racial trait replaces sprinter.</li>\n<li>Curiosity:&nbsp;Mithra are naturally inquisitive about the world around them, though some are more curious than others. Such mithra gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) are always class skills for them. If they choose a class that has either of these Knowledge skills as class skills, they gain a +2 racial bonus on those skills instead. This racial trait replaces natural hunter.</li>\n<li>Dexterous Tail: Mithra with this trait have a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but they can retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action. This racial trait replaces sprinter.</li>\n<li>Jungle Stalker:&nbsp;Mithra often live in deeply forested terrain and they have become naturally sure-footed to maintain their hunting prowess in these dangerous environments. Such mithra gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks and can ignore the first square of difficult terrain caused by foliage each round. This racial trait replaces cat&rsquo;s luck and sprinter.</li>\n<li>Miqo&rsquo;te Heritage:&nbsp;These mithra are not threatened by the Yagudo, but by the Ixal. Mithra with this racial trait gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC versus Ixal enemies. This racial trait replaces lesser defensive training.</li>\n<li>Scent:&nbsp;Some mithra favor a keen sense of smell over sensitive sight. Mithra with this racial trait gain the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\">scent</a>&nbsp;ability. This racial trait replaces the low-<wbr />light vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Mithra Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many mithras follow the general model of the standard mithra, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 8 different potential heritages for mithra PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a mithra, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Skill Modifiers:&nbsp;While most mithras gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a modifier to different skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Mithra Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-83\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Heritage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Ability Modifiers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Alternate Skill Modifiers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Cheetara</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+4 DEX, -2 STR, -2 CON</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Fast and lithe, these speedy mithra seek a fun life in the fast lane.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Jagara</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 WIS, +2 INT, -2 CON</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Knowledge (Arcana), Spellcraft, Use Magic Device</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Wily and knowledgeable, these mithra want to understand the ways of magic.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Keepers of the Moon</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 DEX, +2 WIS, -2 STR</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Acrobatics, Stealth, Survival</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Shying from the garish light of day, they revel in the shroud of night, with most offering their piety to the moon.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Liono</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 STR, +2 CHA, -2 WIS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (Nobility)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Loyal and royalty-borne, these mithra seek to unite all mithra races.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Panthro</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 STR, +2 INT, -2 CHA</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Disable Device, Drive, Knowledge (Technology)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Strong and smart, these mithra want to build unique vehicles and expand technology</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Pumyra</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 DEX, +2 WIS, -2 CON</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Craft (Alchemy), Heal, Sense Motive</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Sleek and wise, these mithra seek to heal the wounded.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Seekers of the Sun</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 DEX, +2 CHA, -2 INT</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Acrobatics, Bluff, Perform (Dance)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Lithe and agile, these diurnal Mithra seek the warm light of the day.

Humes with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bonus Feat:&nbsp;Humes select one extra feat at 1st level.</li>\n<li>Curiosity:&nbsp;Humes naturally inquisitive about the world around them. They gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) become class skills for them. If they choose a class that has either of these Knowledge skills as class skills, they gain a +2 racial bonus on those skills instead.</li>\n<li>Integrated:&nbsp;Humes gain a +1 racial bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Knowledge (local) checks.</li>\n<li>Skilled:&nbsp;Humes gain an additional skill rank at first level and one additional rank whenever they gain a level.</li>\n<li>Sociable:&nbsp;When humes attempt to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude with a Diplomacy check and fail by 5 or more, they can try to influence the creature a second time even if 24 hours have not passed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adoptive Parentage:&nbsp;Humes are sometimes orphaned and adopted by other races. Choose one humanoid race without the hume subtype. You start play with that race&rsquo;s languages and gain that race&rsquo;s weapon familiarity racial trait (if any). If the race does not have weapon familiarity, you gain either Skill Focus or Weapon Focus as a bonus feat that is appropriate for that race instead. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Alchemically Enhanced:&nbsp;Some humes use alchemical or scientific enhancements to push their bodies beyond the limits of nature. However, doing so comes at a significant price. A hume with this trait gains a +3 racial bonus to Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength. However, the character&rsquo;s biology is now more susceptible to chemicals, causing her to take a &ndash;2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws against poison. This racial trait replaces the +2 bonus to any one ability score and the bonus feat racial trait.</li>\n<li>Awareness:&nbsp;Humes raised within monastic traditions or communities that encourage mindfulness seem to shrug off many dangers more easily than other humes. They gain a +1 racial bonus on all saving throws and concentration checks. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat.</li>\n<li>Background Character:&nbsp;Humes who stay away from others are more adept at blending in or hiding away rather than fitting in. Humes with this racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Disguise, Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Stealth checks. This racial trait replaces integrated.</li>\n<li>Comprehensive Education:&nbsp;Humes raised with skilled teachers draw upon vast swathes of knowledge gained over centuries of civilization. They gain all Knowledge skills as class skills, and they gain a +1 racial bonus on all Knowledge skill checks. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Distanced:&nbsp;Some humes found out that curiosity killed the cat, and so aim to better protect themselves against the threats of the world. Humes gain a +4 racial bonus to Acrobatic checks made to move through threatened squares. This racial trait replaces curiosity.</li>\n<li>Dual Talent:&nbsp;Some humes are uniquely skilled at maximizing their natural gifts. These humes pick two ability scores and gain a +2 racial bonus in each of those scores. This racial trait replaces the +2 bonus to any one ability score, the bonus feat, and the skilled traits.</li>\n<li>Emissary:&nbsp;Some humes work to make others believe a single statement rather than improve relations. Once per day, humes may roll twice on a single Bluff or Diplomacy check and take the better roll. This racial trait replaces sociable.</li>\n<li>Eye for Talent:&nbsp;Humes have great intuition for hidden potential. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks. In addition, when they acquire an animal companion, bonded mount, cohort, or familiar, that creature gains a +2 bonus to one ability score of the character&rsquo;s choice. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Focused Study:&nbsp;All humes are skillful, but some, rather than being generalists, tend to specialize in a handful of skills. At 1st, 8th, and 16th level, such humes gain&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/skill-focus-final/\">Skill Focus</a>&nbsp;in a skill of their choice as a bonus feat. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Frontier Survivor:&nbsp;Humes with this trait gain the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/technology-feats/technologist/\">Technologist</a>&nbsp;feat, which grants them understanding of technological subjects. Additionally, they gain a +2 racial bonus on Survival checks in the ruins of cities. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Fields:&nbsp;Humes born in rural areas are used to hard labor. They gain a racial bonus equal to half their character level to any one Craft or Profession skill, and once per day they may ignore an effect that would cause them to become fatigued or exhausted. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Mountains:&nbsp;Humes born in the mountains are skilled at negotiating heights and precipices. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks and Acrobatics checks to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. Furthermore, they are considered acclimated to the effects of high altitude. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Sea:&nbsp;Humes born near the sea are always drawn to it. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Profession (sailor) and Swim checks, and these are always class skills for them. They can hold their breath twice as long as normal, and spellcasters gain a +4 racial bonus on concentration checks when attempting to cast spells underwater. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Slums:&nbsp;Humes who eke out a life in a city&rsquo;s teeming slums must be quick and clever. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Sleight of Hand and Stealth checks, and a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks in urban and underground settings. In addition, they may roll twice when saving against disease, taking the better roll. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Snows:&nbsp;Humes born in chilly climes treat cold climates as one category less severe. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saving throws against the effects of cold climates, on any check or saving throw to avoid slipping and falling, and to CMD against trip combat maneuvers. This bonus applies on Acrobatics and Climb checks made in slippery conditions. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Streets:&nbsp;Humes from bustling cities are skilled with crowds. They gain a +1 racial bonus on Reflex saves and a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class when adjacent to at least two other allies. Crowds do not count as difficult terrain for them. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Sun:&nbsp;Humes born in tropical climates treat hot climates as one category less severe. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saving throws against the effects of a hot climate, as well as against the poison and distraction ability of swarms and vermin. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Wilderness:&nbsp;Humes raised in the wild learn the hard way that only the strong survive. They gain a racial bonus equal to half their character level on Survival checks. They also gain a +5 racial bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying and add half their character level to their Constitution score when determining the negative hit point total necessary to kill them. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heroic:&nbsp;Some humes are born heroes. In campaigns that use the optional hero point system, each time these humes gain a level, they gain 2 hero points instead of 1. If they take the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/blood-of-heroes/\">Blood of Heroes</a>&nbsp;feat, they gain 3 hero points each level instead of 2. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Industrious:&nbsp;Humes are known for their drive and work ethic. Humes with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on concentration checks and checks with their choice of one Craft or Profession skill. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Innovative:&nbsp;Humes have come to shape the world because they are inveterate innovators. Humes with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks to independently research spells, create magic items they have never encountered before, and identify unique magical effects. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on Charisma-based skill checks to persuade others to adopt a new ideology or further the cause of discovery and progress. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Institutional Memory:&nbsp;Humes rely on their institutions to remember the distant past and to preserve their own memories for the distant future. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Knowledge checks to answer questions about any organizations, guilds, or religions to which they belong, and they can attempt such skill checks untrained. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Military Tradition:&nbsp;Several hume cultures raise all children (or all children of a certain social class) to serve in the military or defend themselves with force of arms. They gain proficiency with up to two martial or exotic weapons appropriate to their culture. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Mixed Heritage:&nbsp;Often hume civilization is defined by more than one characteristic. A hume with this trait may select a second &ldquo;Heart of the&rdquo; racial trait. This replaces the bonus feat racial trait.</li>\n<li>One of the Multitude:&nbsp;City-dwelling humes are skilled at blending in with the busy multitudes of the city. They gain a +1 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks when within 10 feet of at least two other humanoids. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attacks of opportunity made while flanking. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Piety:&nbsp;Humes place great trust in the gods to protect them. Humes with this trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks and Knowledge (religion) is always a class skill for them. In addition, once per day before attempting an attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check, such a hume can call out to his deity in order to receive a +2 racial bonus on that roll; he can use this ability only if he is able to speak. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat racial trait.</li>\n<li>Practiced Hunter:&nbsp;Members of some hume cultures train from youth to find and follow the trails of vital game and at the same time hide the evidence of their own passage. These humes gain a +2 racial bonus on Stealth and Survival checks, and Stealth and Survival are always class skills for them. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Silver Tongued:&nbsp;Humes are often adept at subtle manipulation and putting even sworn foes at ease. Humes with this trait gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks. In addition, when they use Diplomacy to shift a creature&rsquo;s attitude, they can shift up to three steps up rather than just two. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Social Ties:&nbsp;Some hume societies run on complex webs of favors and loyalties that canny members can intuitively exploit with relative ease. These humes gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks, and on any skill checks to recruit members and teams for an organization. They also add a +1 racial bonus to their Leadership scores (if they gain the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/leadership/\">Leadership</a>&nbsp;feat). This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Unstoppable Magic:&nbsp;Humes from civilizations built upon advanced magic are educated in a variety of ways to accomplish their magical goals. They gain a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks against spell resistance. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Wayfarer:&nbsp;Humes maintain the largest trade networks and the farthest-reaching civilizations, putting them in contact with a huge number of cultures. Humes with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost, Knowledge (geography) checks, and Knowledge (local) checks. Whenever these humes gain a rank in Linguistics, they learn two languages rather than one. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Hume Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many humes follow the general model of the standard hume, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 3 different potential heritages for hume PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a hume, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Ability:&nbsp;While most humes gain an additional skill rank at first level and one additional rank whenever they gain a level, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a different ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Hume Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-820\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Heritage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Ability Modifiers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Alternate Ability</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Cetra</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2 WIS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">Cetras gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (Arcana and History) skill checks and these two Knowledge skills are class skills.

The sheer strength of their powerful physiques is second to none. They have used their skills to contribute to the construction and development of the numerous mines. Galka are asexual and do not reproduce in the same manner as other species. However, other races typically use the male pronoun to refer to galka, as their physical appearance is more masculine than feminine. Sometime after a galka dies (between a month and a year), the galka&rsquo;s soul is reincarnated into a new body in a Galkan settlement. The newly reincarnated galka has no abilities or traits of the previous soul, and only hazy memories of its previous lives. Once a galka&rsquo;s soul has been reincarnated, the original galka cannot be raised from the dead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/galka/\">View Galka on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">20 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d12 years<br />(21 &ndash; 32 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d12 years<br />(22 &ndash; 44 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+3d12 years<br />(23 &ndash; 56 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive&nbsp;includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li>Self-Taught&nbsp;includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li>Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">55 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">90</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">120</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+6d20<br />(126 - 240 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ol>\n<li>At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">7 ft. 0 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d12 in.<br />(7 ft. 1 in. &ndash; 8 ft. 0 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">350 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(1d12x12 lbs.)<br />(362 &ndash; 494 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;Galka are strong, solid, stable, and stoic.

They gain a +2 racial bonus to Intimidate checks.</li>\n<li>Mining Servitude:&nbsp;Galka are used to being forced into the mines. They gain a +2 racial bonus on profession (miner) checks.</li>\n<li>Metalworker:&nbsp;The galka have worked with metals most of their lives. They gain a +2 racial bonus to Appraise and Craft checks involving metal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ferocity:&nbsp;Once per day, when a galka is brought below 0 hit points but not killed, he can fight on for 1 more round as if disabled. At the end of his next turn, unless brought to above 0 hit points, he immediately falls unconscious and begins dying.</li>\n<li>Hated:&nbsp;Due to their history of war and being exploited, the galka gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against antica and hume.</li>\n<li>Relentless:&nbsp;Galka gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to bull rush or overrun an opponent. This bonus only applies while both the Galka and its opponent are standing on the ground.</li>\n<li>Weapon Familiarity:&nbsp;Galka are proficient with the War pick and Galkan racial weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;Galka have low-<wbr />light vision allowing them to see twice as far as humes in dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Architectural Ingenuity:&nbsp;Some galka demonstrate incredible talent for building and adjusting structures. These galka gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks and on Craft and Perception checks related to structures (including structural traps). This racial trait replaces metalworker.</li>\n<li>Beastmaster:&nbsp;Some galka have a spiritual kinship with fantastical beasts, capturing them for sport or living and hunting with them. A galka with this trait treats whips and nets as martial weapons and gains a +2 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks. This racial trait replaces ferocity.</li>\n<li>Cavewight:&nbsp;Some galka live far below the surface, seeking freedom in winding cave complexes. Galka with this racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Survival checks made underground. This racial trait replaces the imposing figure.</li>\n<li>Chain Fighter:&nbsp;Some galka have escaped from slavery and reforged the chains of their imprisonment into deadly weapons. Galka with this racial trait are proficient with flails and heavy flails, and treat dire flails and spiked chains as martial weapons. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>City-<wbr />Raised:&nbsp;Galka with this racial trait know little of their galka ancestry and were raised among humes and other galka in a large city. City-<wbr />raised galka are proficient with whips and longswords, and receive a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (local) checks. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Darkvision:&nbsp;Some galka have lived in the underground depths for so long they have given up on light entirely and gained darkvision with a range of 60 feet. This racial trait replaces low-<wbr />light vision and metalworker.</li>\n<li>Scavenger:&nbsp;Some galka eke out a leaving picking over the garbage heaps of society, and must learn to separate rare finds from the inevitable dross. Galka with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks and on Perception checks to find hidden objects (including traps and secret doors), determine whether food is spoiled, or identify a potion by taste. This racial trait replaces imposing figure.</li>\n<li>Stoic:&nbsp;Some galka learn to suppress their strong emotions. They don&rsquo;t usually gain morale bonuses, but instead gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against emotion and fear effects, and the DC to intimidate them increases by 2. They can choose to gain morale bonuses when they would normally be able to do so, but if they do, they lose the benefits from this racial trait for 24 hours. This racial trait replaces intimidating and ferocity.</li>\n<li>Tenacious:&nbsp;City-dwelling galka must often be tenacious to get by. Once per day, if a galka fails a Fortitude save, Will save, or Constitution check, he can reroll the save or check. The galka must take the second result, even if it is worse.

Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ancestral Arms:&nbsp;Some half-breeds receive training in an unusual weapon. Half-breeds with this racial trait receive Exotic Weapon Proficiency or Martial Weapon Proficiency with one weapon as a bonus feat at 1st level. This racial trait replaces&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">the feat and skill or offense racial trait</span>.</li>\n<li>Dual Minded:&nbsp;The mixed ancestry of some half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breeds</span>&nbsp;makes them resistant to mental attacks. Half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breed</span>s with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws. This racial trait replaces the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">defense</span>&nbsp;racial trait.</li>\n<li>Eye for Opportunity:&nbsp;Constantly facing the rough edges of two societies, some half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breed</span>s develop a knack for finding overlooked opportunities. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attacks of opportunity. This racial trait replaces the defense racial trait.</li>\n<li>Mismatched:&nbsp;Rather than having bodily and facial features that are a blend of&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">both races</span>, or tending towards one parent or the other, a rare few half-breeds have a strange combination of features. They have noticeable mismatched eyes and ears, as well as uneven limbs. Half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breed</span>s with this trait take a &ndash;2 penalty on Reflex saves but receive a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks. This racial trait replaces the feat and skill racial traits.</li>\n<li>Scavenger:&nbsp;Forced to survive on their own as outcasts, some Half-Breeds learn to make do with what little they have. Half-Breeds with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Appraise and Perception checks to find hidden objects (including traps and secret doors), determine whether food is spoiled, or identify a potion by taste. This racial trait replaces multitalented.</li>\n<li>Sociable:&nbsp;Half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breed</span>s are skilled at charming others and recovering from faux pas. If half-breeds with this racial trait attempt to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude with a Diplomacy check and fail by 5 or more, they can try to influence the creature a second time even if 24 hours have not passed. This racial trait replaces the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">feat and skill</span>&nbsp;racial trait.</li>\n<li>Stubborn:&nbsp;Some Half-breeds, either due to prejudice or being physically or mentally inferior to one of their parent&rsquo;s races, learn to overcome their circumstances through sheer, unbridled willpower. Half-Breeds with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Will saving throws to resist spells and spell-like abilities of the enfeebling school. In addition, if a half-breed fails such a save, it receives another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect (assuming the spell or spell-like ability has a duration greater than 1 round). This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If the half-breed has a similar ability from another source, it can only use one of these abilities per round, but can try the other on the second round if the first reroll ability fails. This racial trait replaces multitalented.</li>\n<li>Wary:&nbsp;Many half-breeds have spent their long lives moving from place to place, often driven out by the hostility of others. Such experiences have made them wary of others&rsquo; motivations. half-breeds with this trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Sense Motive and Bluff checks. This racial trait replaces the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">feat and skill</span>&nbsp;racial trait.</li>\n<li>Water Child:&nbsp;Some half-breeds have adapted to life on or near the water. These half-breeds gain a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks, can always take 10 while swimming, and may choose Aquan as a bonus language.

They are also skillful merchants, their cheerful disposition often charming potential customers. Moogles typically get no taller than 3 to 4 feet. They tend to have small eyes (like moles) and black, red, or purple bat-<wbr />like wings. Their most distinguishing feature is a single black antenna that sticks up from the head with a small, usually red, ball (or &ldquo;pompom&rdquo;) at the end. Their ears are usually shaped like a cat&rsquo;s, but sometimes they have longer rabbit-<wbr />like ears. Most Moogles have white or pink fur. When speaking hume languages, they tend to end their sentences with the sound &lsquo;kupo&rsquo;. Moogles are mostly found in large cities, working as engineers, or serving aboard airships. They are avid storytellers and holders of many superstitions. Moogles also hate water, preferring instead to bathe in dust or sand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/moogle/\">View Moogle on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">25 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 years<br />(26 &ndash; 31 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d6 years<br />(27 &ndash; 37 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+3d6 years<br />(28 &ndash; 43 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Intuitive&nbsp;includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Self-Taught&nbsp;includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">56 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">84</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">112</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+3d20<br />(115 - 172 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2 ft. 6 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d10 in.<br />(2 ft. 7 in. &ndash; 3 ft. 4 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">45 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(1d10x1 lbs.)<br />(46 &ndash; 55 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2 ft. 4 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d8 in.<br />(2 ft. 5 in. &ndash; 3 ft.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">40 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(1d8x1 lbs.)<br />(41 &ndash; 48 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;Moogles&rsquo; small stature makes them weaker than other races, but moogles have nimble hands and are easy to get along with. They gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, and &ndash;2 Strength.</li>\n<li>Type:&nbsp;Moogles are Humanoid creatures with the moogle subtype.</li>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Moogles are Small creatures and thus gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a &ndash;1 penalty to their Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.</li>\n<li>Base Speed:&nbsp;Moogles have a base speed of 20 feet on land. While moogle wings are too small to provide true flight, lingering remnants of their fey heritage allow moogles to achieve limited flight for short periods of time while wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. A moogle can fly with clumsy maneuverability a number of rounds at a time equal to his Constitution bonus. A moogle can attempt to fly for longer durations by making Constitution check each additional round of flight (DC 10 + 2 per extra round). A moogle&rsquo;s natural fly speed is equal to his base land speed. After flying, a moogle must rest a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent flying before flying again. Additionally, a moogle gains +4 on Acrobatics checks as long as he is able to fly.</li>\n<li>Languages:&nbsp;Moogles begin play speaking Common and Moogle. Moogles with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Aklo, Auran, Draconic, Goblin, Numish, and Sylvan. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Defensive Training:&nbsp;Moogles gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC against monsters of the giant subtype.</li>\n<li>Eternal Hope:&nbsp;Moogles rarely lose hope and are always confident that even hopeless situations will work out. Moogles receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against fear and despair effects. Additionally, once per day, after rolling a 1 on a d20, the moogle may reroll and use the second result.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emissary:&nbsp;Once per day, moogles can roll twice when making a Bluff or Diplomacy check and take the better roll.</li>\n<li>Good Merchant:&nbsp;Moogles seem to have the innate ability to identify the value of items and sell them at a good margin. Moogles receive a +2 racial bonus on all Appraise checks. Furthermore, moogles gain a +2 racial bonus on all Diplomacy checks concerning any type of business transaction.</li>\n<li>Handy:&nbsp;Moogles receive a +2 racial bonus on a Craft or Profession skill of their choice.</li>\n<li>Keen Senses:&nbsp;Moogles receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.</li>\n<li>Scavenger:&nbsp;Moogles gain a +2 racial bonus on Appraise and Perception checks to find hidden objects (including traps and secret doors), determine whether food is spoiled, or identify a potion by taste.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Construct Familiarity:&nbsp;Moogles get a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against constructs and receive a +4 dodge bonus to AC against them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;Moogles can see twice as far as humes in conditions of dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hydrophobia:&nbsp;When drenched in water or some other liquid, a moogle receives a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty on attack rolls and concentration checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Academician:&nbsp;Some moogles are more academically inclined than their kin. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on any single Knowledge skill. This racial trait replaces good merchant.</li>\n<li>Attentive:&nbsp;Moogles with this trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks. This bonus increases to +4 to notice when someone is enchanted or possessed. This racial trait replaces handy.</li>\n<li>Darkvision:&nbsp;Some moogle strains have lived in the underground depths for so long they have given up on light entirely and gained darkvision with a range of 60 feet. This racial trait replaces low-<wbr />light vision and keen senses.</li>\n<li>Engineer:&nbsp;Moogle engineers tinker endlessly with fire, explosives, and the engines of war. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) and Knowledge (engineering) checks. This racial trait replaces good merchant.</li>\n<li>Explorer:&nbsp;Many moogles are obsessed with seeing as much of the world as possible, rather than perfecting some specific talent or vocation. These moogles gain a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks and checks for one Knowledge skill of their choice. This racial trait replaces construct familiarity and good merchant.</li>\n<li>Gift of Tongues:&nbsp;Moogles love languages and learning about those they meet. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks, and they learn one additional language every time they put a rank in the Linguistics skill. This racial trait replaces defensive training and handy.</li>\n<li>Grounded:&nbsp;Some moogles lack their innate ability to fly. Not being ones to give up, they let nothing stop them! These moogles still move at speed of 20 ft, but are no longer slowed down by encumberance, medium/heavy armor and similar effects. They also gain +1 racial bonus on saves against effects that would reduce their movement speed. This racial trait modifies their&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">base</span>&nbsp;speed.</li>\n<li>Knack with Poison:&nbsp;Some moogles have an instinctive understanding of poisons and their uses. Moogles gain a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to make poison. The bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poisons increases to +4 if the moogle accidentally poisons himself when applying or readying the substance. This racial trait replaces construct familiarity and good merchant.</li>\n<li>Kupo-Recovery:&nbsp;For some moogles, the promise of a kupo-nut is enough to push them beyond their normal limits. If a moogle with this racial trait is dying, and a creature gives it a taste of a kupo-nut (a standard action for an adjacent creature), it immediately stabilizes. This racial trait replaces handy.</li>\n<li>Low Blow:&nbsp;Some moogles train extensively in the art of attacking larger creatures. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on critical confirmation rolls against opponents larger than themselves. This racial trait replaces handy.</li>\n<li>Master Tinker:&nbsp;Moogles experiment with all manner of mechanical devices. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on Disable Device and Knowledge (engineering) checks. They are also treated as proficient with any non-exotic weapon they have personally crafted. This racial trait replaces defensive training and good merchant.</li>\n<li>Mognet:&nbsp;Some Moogles share a psychic bond with other members of their race, allowing them to connect to each other across great distances. Once per week, a moogle with this racial trait can send a message to another moogle, as though using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/s/sending/\">Sending</a>&nbsp;spell. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n<li>Moogle Magic:&nbsp;Rarely, fey ancestry will manifest in moogles attuned to their heritage. Moogles with Charisma scores of 11 or higher gain the following spell-<wbr />like abilities 1/day:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/dancing-lights/\">dancing lights</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-magic\">detect magic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/g/grab\">grab</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/i/ignite\">ignite</a>. The caster level for these effects is equal to the moogle&rsquo;s level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + the moogle&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. This racial trait replaces good merchant and handy.</li>\n<li>Outrider:&nbsp;Some moogles specialize in mounted combat. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks. This racial trait replaces good merchant.</li>\n<li>Shiftless:&nbsp;Some moogles have a reputation for larceny and guile&mdash;and sometimes it&rsquo;s well deserved. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Bluff and Sleight of Hand checks, and Sleight of Hand is always a class skill for them. This racial trait replaces handy.</li>\n<li>Unfettered:&nbsp;Former slips liberated from slavery train to ensure they will never be slaves again. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks and a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against effects that cause the entangled condition, to CMD against grapples, and on combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple. This racial trait replaces handy and good merchant.</li>\n<li>Wanderlust:&nbsp;Moogles love travel and maps. Moogles with this racial trait receive a +2 bonus on Knowledge (geography) and Survival checks. When casting spells or using abilities that provide or enhance movement, moogles treat their caster level as +1 higher than normal. This racial trait replaces handy and good merchant.</li>\n<li>Wright:&nbsp;Some moogles prefer to use their natural talents with mechanisms to drive machines. These moogles gain a +2 racial bonus on Drive checks and on Craft and Repair checks to build or repair vehicles. This racial trait replace handy and scavenger.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Moogle Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many m<span lang=\"en-US\">oogle</span>s follow the general model of the standard m<span lang=\"en-US\">oogle</span>, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 5 different potential heritages for m<span lang=\"en-US\">oogle</span>&nbsp;PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a m<span lang=\"en-US\">oogle</span>, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Skill Modifiers:&nbsp;While most m<span lang=\"en-US\">oogle</span>s gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a modifier to a different skill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Moogle Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-651\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Heritage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Ability Modifiers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Alternate Skill Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Chalice Keepers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 CON, +2 CHA, -2 WIS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Knowledge (Nature)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">After years of carrying a large vase meant to collect Myrrh, these smaller puffier moogles have gained significantly muscle.

Having formed two incredibly fearless orders of knights, the elvaans subjugated just about the whole of the Quon continent. They destroyed beastmen strongholds, and tarutaru villages were no match for the San d&rsquo;ria knights anyhow. Sadly for them, the flood of victories came to an end when the hume and the galka of Bastok combined their strength and technology against them in the second battle of Konschtat. Defeated, the proud Elvaan kingdom was unable to bear the humiliation in peace. The result was internal turmoil and civil war. Gradually, the conquered lands slipped away from their rule as well, and the elvaans retreated to San d&rsquo;ria. A strong sense of faith and pride means that the elvaans are essentially an aristocratic race. The elvaan trait of firm belief makes them admirable models of faith. Not only do they stay clear of questionable activities, they take great pride in their race as well. Both male and female elvaans are known to be swordsmen of the highest order because of their strength of mind and vitality. Close to the hume in their looks, the elvaans usually shun the world of commerce preferring to live by the sword.

See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fearless:&nbsp;Elvaans gain a +2 racial bonus on all saving throws against fear effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keen Senses:&nbsp;Elvaans receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.</li>\n<li>Martial Background:&nbsp;Elvaans receives the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat-final/\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;feat for free at first level, and may apply it to any single weapon he is proficient in.</li>\n<li>Noble Upbringing:&nbsp;Elvaans take great pride in their history, culture, and government. They receive a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nobility) and Knowledge (history) checks and treat these skills as class skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gatecrasher:&nbsp;Elvaans gain a +2 racial bonus on Strength checks to break objects and a +2 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder.</li>\n<li>Hatred:&nbsp;Elvaans receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the orc and goblin subtypes due to special training against these hated foes.</li>\n<li>Weapon Familiarity:&nbsp;Elvaans are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, and shortbows (including composite shortbows).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />light Vision:&nbsp;An elvaan can see twice as far as a hume in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arcane Focus:&nbsp;Some elvaan families have such long traditions of producing mages (and other spellcasters) that they raise their children with the assumption each is destined to be a powerful magic-user, with little need for mundane concerns such as skill with weapons. Elvaans with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on concentration checks made to cast spells defensively. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Darkvision:&nbsp;Though uncommon, some groups of elvaans are born with darkvision, rather than low-<wbr />light vision. Elvaans with this racial trait gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet, but also gain sensitivity to light and are dazzled in areas of bright light or within the radius of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/daylight/\">daylight</a>&nbsp;spell. This racial trait replaces low-<wbr />light vision.</li>\n<li>Desert Runner:&nbsp;Some elvaans thrive in the deepest deserts, forever roaming across burned and parched lands. Elvaans with this racial trait receive a +4 racial bonus on Constitution checks and Fortitude saves to avoid fatigue, exhaustion, or ill effects from running, forced marches, starvation, thirst, or hot or cold environments. This racial trait replaces noble upbringing.</li>\n<li>Elemental Resistance:&nbsp;Elvaans who dwell in the most extreme environments, from arctic wastelands to volcanic plains, develop natural resistance to the dangers of their homelands over the course of a few generations. Elvaans with this racial trait gain elemental resistance 5 to earth, fire, ice, lighting, water, or wind. This choice is made at character creation, and once made it cannot be changed. This racial trait replaces martial background.</li>\n<li>Fleet-<wbr />Footed:&nbsp;While all elvaans are naturally lithe and agile, some also are naturally speedy and have a strong desire to rush into situations rather than worrying about looking ahead. Elvaans with this racial trait receive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/run-final/\">Run</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks. This racial trait replaces noble upbringing and martial background.</li>\n<li>Illusion Resistance:&nbsp;Elvaans are normally fearless in battle, though some of their kind train specifically against the effects of illusionists. Elvaans gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusion spells or effects. This racial trait replaces fearless.</li>\n<li>Long-Limbed:&nbsp;Elvaans with this racial trait have a base move speed of 35 feet. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Resistant:&nbsp;Spending years training their mind against the invasion of other&rsquo;s influences, an elvaan protects all aspects of themselves during combat. Elvaans gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and poison. This racial trait replaces gatecrasher.</li>\n<li>Slender:&nbsp;Elvaans often appear unnaturally thin by other races&rsquo; standards. Elvaans with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks, on combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple, and to CMD against grapples. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Spirit of the Waters:&nbsp;Some elvaans have adapted to life in tune with the sea or along the reedy depths of wild rivers and lakes. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks, can always take 10 while swimming, and may choose Aquan as a bonus language. They are proficient with longspear, trident, and net. This racial trait replaces noble upbringing and weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Urbanite:&nbsp;Elvaans who live in cities for more than a century can grow to know the ebb and flow of social situations just as their forest-dwelling cousins know the rules of the wild. Elvaans with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks made to gather information and Sense Motive checks made to get a hunch about a social situation. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Elvaan Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">elvaan</span>s follow the general model of the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">standard elvaan</span>, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 4 different potential heritages for&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">elvaan</span>&nbsp;PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating an&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">elvaan</span>, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Ability:&nbsp;While most&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">elvaan</span>s&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">focuses their hatred for orcs and goblins</span>, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a different ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Elvaan Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-650\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Heritage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Ability Modifiers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Alternate Ability</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Duskwight</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2 STR, +2 INT, -2 CHA</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">Whenever characters with this trait benefit from concealment or full concealment due to darkness or dim light, they gain a +2 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Stealth checks.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">Duskwight Elvaan have spent decades in the peace and seclusion of various caves and caverns, resulting in acute senses one would expect from living in the darkness.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Ishgardian</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2 STR, +2 CHA, -2 WIS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">+1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the elvaan and draconic subtypes due to special training against these hated foes.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">As a result of long decades of ceaseless warfare with the Dravanian Horde, the intensity of the faith of the Church of Halone, and years of bitter cold and snow, Ishgardian Elvaans tend to be much more intense compared to their brethren, and much more devoted.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">San d'Orian</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2 STR, +2 WIS, -2 INT</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">Once per day, when an elvaan is brought below 0 hit points but not killed, he can fight on for 1 more round as if disabled.

Tarutarus lack the physical strength and durability of their fellow enlightened races as a result of their racial prejudice towards magical study, but they do control greater reserves of magical power as a result, and are the most studious and intelligent of the races.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/tarutaru/\">View Tarutaru on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Adulthood</td>\n<td>Intuitive</td>\n<td>Self-Taught</td>\n<td>Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>7 years</td>\n<td>+1d2 years<br />(8 &ndash; 9 years)</td>\n<td>+1d4 years<br />(29 &ndash; 49 years)</td>\n<td>+1d6 years<br />(31 &ndash; 61 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ol>\n<li>This category includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li>This category includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li>This category includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>13 years</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>+1d10<br />(36 - 45 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ol>\n<li>At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2 ft. 7 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d10 in.<br />(2 ft. 8 in. &ndash; 3 ft. 5 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">75 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(1d10x1 lbs.)<br />(76 &ndash; 85 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2 ft. 7 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d10 in.<br />(2 ft. 8 in. &ndash; 3 ft. 5 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">70 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(1d10x1 lbs.)<br />(71 &ndash; 80 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;Tarutarus are quick in both mind and body, but physically frail.

This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If the tarutaru has a similar ability from another source, it can only use one of these abilities per round, but can try the other on the second round if the first reroll ability fails.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Magic Expert:&nbsp;Tarutarus value knowledge and learning about the field of magic.

They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Academician:&nbsp;Some tarutarus are more academically inclined than their kin. Tarutarus with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on any single Knowledge skill. This racial trait replaces talented.</li>\n<li>Architectural Ingenuity:&nbsp;Some tarutarus demonstrate incredible talent for building and adjusting structures. These tarutarus gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks and on Craft and Perception checks related to structures (including structural traps). This racial trait replaces talented.</li>\n<li>Dirty Trickster:&nbsp;All tarutarus love pranks, but some specialize in those improvised during battle. These tarutarus gain a +2 racial bonus on dirty trick combat maneuvers. They need not meet the Intelligence requirement to select Combat Expertise, Improved Dirty Trick, and any feat with Improved Dirty Trick as a prerequisite. This racial trait replaces defensive training and talented.</li>\n<li>Eternal Hope:&nbsp;Tarutarus rarely lose hope and are always confident that even hopeless situations will work out. Tarutarus with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against fear and despair effects. Once per day, after rolling a 1 on a d20, the tarutaru may reroll and use the second result. This racial trait replaces defensive training.</li>\n<li>Explorer:&nbsp;Many tarutarus are obsessed with seeing as much of the world as possible, rather than perfecting some specific talent or vocation. These tarutarus gain a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks and checks for one Knowledge skill of their choice. This racial trait replaces talented and spell focus.</li>\n<li>Inquisitive:&nbsp;Tarutarus have a knack for being in places they shouldn&rsquo;t be. Tarutarus with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Disable Device and Escape Artist checks. This racial trait replaces magic expert.</li>\n<li>Intrepid Settler:&nbsp;Some tarutarus add to the thrill of living by settling in precarious places. These intrepid tarutarus gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against fear effects and on Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim checks. This racial trait replaces magic expert and talented.</li>\n<li>Magical Linguist:&nbsp;Tarutarus study languages in both their mundane and supernatural manifestations. Tarutarus with this racial trait add +1 to the DC of spells they cast with the language-<wbr />dependent descriptor or those that create glyphs, symbols, or other magical writings. They gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against such spells. Tarutarus with Charisma scores of 11 or higher also gain the following spell-<wbr />like abilities: 1/day&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/c/comprehend-languages/\">comprehend languages</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/m/message\">message</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/r/read-magic\">read magic</a>. The caster level for these effects is equal to the tarutaru&rsquo;s level. This racial trait replaces spell-<wbr />like ability.</li>\n<li>Polyglot:&nbsp;Some tarutarus, especially those who spend a lot of time traveling, develop a talent for learning new languages. These tarutarus gain a +2 racial bonus on Linguistics checks, and it is always a class skill for them. Tarutarus with this racial trait also begin play with the ability to speak Common, Lalafellan, and any one other language of their choice in addition to bonus languages due to high Intelligence. They still gain the normal list of tarutaru bonus languages. This racial trait replaces magic expert and alters the tarutaru language racial trait.</li>\n<li>Practicality:&nbsp;Tarutarus value hard work and common sense. Tarutarus with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on any one Craft or Profession skill, as well as on Sense Motive checks and saves against illusions. This racial trait replaces magic expert and magic aptitude.</li>\n<li>Student of the City:&nbsp;Tarutarus of the city learn all they can from newcomers and tend to make contacts in all quarters. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (local) checks, and can use that skill to gather information in place of Diplomacy. This racial trait replaces talented.</li>\n<li>Vivacious:&nbsp;Some tarutarus recover 50% more hit points (minimum 1) whenever they recover hit points from rest. Whenever they are healed of hit point damage by a spell, they heal an additional amount equal to 1/2 the spell&rsquo;s caster level (minimum 0). The extra healing does not apply to spells that grant fast healing or similar effects. This racial trait replaces magic resistant.</li>\n<li>Warden of Nature:&nbsp;Tarutarus must often protect their homes against unnatural or pestilential infestations. Tarutarus with this racial trait gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against aberrations, oozes, and vermin, and a +1 bonus on attack rolls against them because of their special training. This racial trait replaces defensive training.</li>\n<li>Wright:&nbsp;Some tarutarus prefer to use their natural talents with mechanisms to drive machines. These tarutarus gain a +2 racial bonus on Drive checks and on Craft and Repair checks to build or repair vehicles. This racial trait replaces talented and magic expert.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Tarutaru Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many tarutarus follow the general model of the standard tarutaru, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 4 different potential heritages for tarutaru PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a tarutaru, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Skill Modifiers:&nbsp;While most tarutarus gain a +2 racial bonus on a Craft or Profession check of their choice, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a modifier to a different skill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Tarutaru Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-653\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 20%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Heritage</th>\n<th style=\"width: 20%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Ability Modifiers</th>\n<th style=\"width: 20%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Alternate Skill Modifier</th>\n<th style=\"width: 40%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Dunesfolk Lalafell</td>\n<td>+2 INT, +2 DEX, -2 CON</td>\n<td>Appraise or Bluff</td>\n<td>Sly, conniving, power-hungry, and overall much more perverted than your typical tarutaru, they can make deals and bargains with the best, always seemingly ending in their favor.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gnome</td>\n<td>+2 DEX, +2 CHA, -2 WIS</td>\n<td>Stealth or Spellcraft</td>\n<td>Gnomes are renowned for their way with words, but also their naivet&eacute;.

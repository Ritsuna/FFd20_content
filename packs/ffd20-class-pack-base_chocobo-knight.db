(1/day), chosen when the chocobo knight gains 20th level.<br />A chocobo knight does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Endurance as a bonus feat. A chocobo knight&rsquo;s bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other&rsquo;s moods and moves. Should a chocobo knight&rsquo;s mount die, the chocobo knight may find another chocobo to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, improved evasion, or blood bond special abilities until the next time the chocobo knight gains a level.</p>\n<p><em>Class Level:</em>&nbsp;The character&rsquo;s chocobo knight level. The chocobo knight&rsquo;s class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to a companion for the purpose of determining the companion&rsquo;s statistics.</p>\n<p><em>HD:</em>&nbsp;This is the total number of ten-<wbr />sided (d10) Hit Dice the animal companion possesses, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal.</p>\n<p><em>BAB:</em> This is the animal companion&rsquo;s base attack bonus. Chocobos do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.</p>\n<p><em>Fort/Ref/Will:</em>&nbsp;These are the chocobo&rsquo;s base saving throw bonuses. A chocobo has good Fortitude and Reflex saves.</p>\n<p><em>Skills:</em>&nbsp;This lists the total skill ranks for the chocobo. Chocobos can assign skill ranks to any skill listed below. If a&nbsp;chocobo increases its Intelligence to 10 or higher, it gains bonus skill ranks as normal. Animal companions with an Intelligence of 3 or higher can purchase ranks in any skill. A&nbsp;chocobo cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice.</p>\n<p>Chocobos can have ranks in any of the following skills:</p>\n<p>Acrobatics* (Dex), Climb* (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly* (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Perception* (Wis), Stealth* (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim* (Str).</p>\n<p>All of the skills marked with an (*) are class skills for chocobos. Chocobos with an Intelligence of 3 or higher can put ranks into any skill.</p>\n<p><em>Feats:</em>&nbsp;This is the total number of feats possessed by a chocobo. Chocobos should select their feats from those listed below. Chocobos can select other feats, although they are unable to utilize some feats (such as Martial Weapon Proficiency).</p>\n<p>Chocobos can select from the following feats:</p>\n<p>Acrobatic, Agile Maneuvers, Armor Proficiency (light, medium, and heavy), Athletic, Blind-<wbr />Fight, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Dodge, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Initiative, Improved Natural Armor, Improved Natural Attack, Improved Overrun, Intimidating Prowess, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Power Attack, Run, Skill Focus, Spring Attack, Stealthy, Toughness, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus.</p>\n<p>Chocobos with an Intelligence of 3 or higher can select any feat they are physically capable of using. GMs might expand this list to include feats from other sources.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Natural Armor Bonus:</em>&nbsp;The number noted here is an improvement to the chocobo&rsquo;s existing natural armor bonus.</li>\n<li><em>Str/Dex Bonus:</em>&nbsp;Add this value to the chocobo&rsquo;s Strength and Dexterity scores.</li>\n<li><em>Bonus Tricks:</em>&nbsp;The value given in this column is the total number of &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the chocobo knight might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks don&rsquo;t require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don&rsquo;t count against the normal limit of tricks known by the chocobo. The chocobo knight selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can&rsquo;t be changed.</li>\n<li><em>Link (Ex):</em>&nbsp;A chocobo knight can handle his companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if he doesn&rsquo;t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The chocobo knight gains a +4 competence bonus on all Handle Animal checks made regarding his chocobo.</li>\n<li><em>Evasion (Ex):</em>&nbsp;If the chocobo is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</li>\n<li><em>Devotion (Ex):</em>&nbsp;The chocobo gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enfeebling spells and effects.</li>\n<li><em>Ability Score Increase (Ex):</em>&nbsp;The chocobo adds +1 to any one of its ability scores.</li>\n<li><em>Multiattack:</em>&nbsp;The chocobo gains Multiattack as a bonus feat even though it does not have three or more natural attacks. The chocobo instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a &ndash;5 penalty.</li>\n<li><em>Improved Evasion (Ex):</em>&nbsp;When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the chocobo takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.</li>\n<li><em>Blood Bond (Ex):</em> After a chocobo knight has achieved 18th level, the bond between him and his chocobo grows so strong that the chocobo gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls, checks and saves if it witnesses the chocobo knight being threatened or harmed. This bonus lasts as long as the threat is immediate and apparent.</li>\n</ul>","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","max":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"chocoboMount","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":["Chocobo Knight"]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"classSkills":{},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"soundEffect":"","nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]},"conditionals":[]},"ownership":{"default":0,"N1fw6b6C7kQcxuhL":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"ffd20","systemVersion":"10.2.4","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1667423417294,"modifiedTime":1694209592371,"lastModifiedBy":"VNk1dF8h7rdEhEd4"}}

A chocobo knight can maintain his commander’s aura for a number of rounds each day equal to 4 + the chocobo knight’s Charisma modifier; this duration may be divided in whichever fashion the chocobo knight pleases. At each level after 1st, he can maintain his commander’s aura for an additional 2 round per day. Whenever a chocobo knight projects his commander’s aura, he can select one of the following aura abilities, providing bonuses to all allies inside the aura. A chocobo knight can spend a swift action to switch the bonus provided by this ability. At 7th level, he can instead use an <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/pathfinder-basics/#immediate\">immediate action</a> to switch the bonus provided by this ability.</p><ul><li><strong>Armored Adage</strong>: All allies gain DR 2/-.

These temporary hit points refresh at the beginning of each of the ally’s turns as long as this aura is maintained.</li><li><strong>Defensive Strategum:</strong> All allies gain a +1 morale bonus to their armor class.

This chocobo functions as a beastmaster’s animal companion, using the chocobo knight’s level as his effective beastmaster level. A chocobo knight’s mount does not gain the shared saves special ability. If a chocobo knight enhances his chocobo mount with <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/equipment/chocobo-food/\">chocobo food</a>, all permanent food buffs carry over in advancements. But if the chocobo knight’s chocobo mount dies, all permanent food buffs are lost if he summons a new one.<br>Unlike normal chocobos of its kind, a chocobo’s Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the chocobo knight advances in level. If a character receives a companion from more than one source, his effective chocobo knight levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion.

of the medic.</p>\n<h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Medics are proficient with all simple weapons, simple firearms, and any light piercing weapons. They are proficient with light armor but not with any shields.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the medic receives the Limit Breaks (Keen Eye and Regenerative Aura).</p>\n<p>Keen Eye (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the medic to make precise strikes to deal vital damage to her opponents. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four medic levels after 1st, the medic deals an extra + 1d6 points of damage on any successful attacks with an additional + 1d6 per four medic levels after 1st. In addition, any surgical precision extra damage does not require her opponent to be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC to deal this extra damage while this limit break is in effect. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<p>Regenerative Aura (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break creates an aura around the medic that extends out to 15 feet, granting all allies within the area of effect of Fast Healing of 5 + 3 per four medic levels after 1st. This limit break lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four medic levels after 1st. In addition, each round this limit break is in effect allows the medic to cure one status effect per person within the area of effect as a free action. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"triage\">Triage (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A medic must be able to react immediately to any danger that threatens her allies. At 1st level, a medic gains the ability to perform a triage as a standard action, which provokes attacks of opportunity. When she does, she can move up to her base movement speed, so long as she ends her movement adjacent to a living ally. That ally is healed for 1d6 + 1 per rank in her Heal skill + her Wisdom modifier in hit points. Only living allies can be healed this way. This increases by 1d6 per medic level thereafter. In addition, she can apply the effects of one of her medical practices (see below) to the ally, if applicable. Applying triage also stops any bleeding effects. The medic can also perform a triage on herself, doing so only requires a swift action, which doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity; she does not move when she does so. A medic can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her medic level plus her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the medic can spend a full round action (which also provokes attacks of opportunity) to apply her triage to multiple allies at once. If she does so, she can move up to twice her base movement speed. Any ally that the medic is adjacent to at any point during this movement is healed for the medic&rsquo;s triage amount. In addition, the medic can apply the normal number of medical practices for a medic of her level to each healed ally. Each ally can only benefit from the full-round use of triage&rsquo;s healing once per use of the ability. Using triage in this way costs two uses of the ability. The medic only provokes attacks of opportunity from activating triage or from moving as part of the triage ability, but not both.</p>\n<h3 id=\"medical-specialist\">Medical Specialist (Ex)</h3>\n<p>The medic receives a competence bonus equal to half her medic level to her Heal skill (minimum +1).</p>\n<h3 id=\"medic-training\">Medic Training (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Early on in her career, a medic quickly learns to assess the battlefield in order to prioritize the needs of her allies against the dangers that her enemies present. Once per round, as a free action, (even if it is not her turn) the medic can assess the health of her allies. The medic is able to determine their current hit points, any conditions, poisons or diseases affecting them and the duration of these conditions, poisons or diseases, including supernatural diseases. As part of using this ability, the medic may also make a Heal check to assess the current health and condition of her opponents. The DC for this check is equal to 10 + the opponent in question&rsquo;s HD. The check is made against each opponent HD individually and can only be attempted once per round, failing this check against an opponent prevents the medic from attempting to assess that opponent&rsquo;s condition for 1 round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"finesse-training\">Finesse Training (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, a medic gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-finesse-combat-final/\">Weapon Finesse</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the medic from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The medic can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"medical-practice\">Medical Practice</h3>\n<p>As the medic gains experience, she picks up various useful tricks to help her be more effective at the job of saving her friends. At 2nd level, the medic learns one practice, and she learns a new practice at 4th level and every two medic levels thereafter. Medical practice that apply to her use of her triage ability are marked with an asterisk *. A medic can only apply one medical practice that applies to her triage ability each time she uses triage. The medic can choose from the following list of practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of medical practices can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/medic/medical-practices/\">Medical Practices</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"surgical-precision\">Surgical Precision (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, the medic learns how to make a precise strike, dealing extra damage. The medic&rsquo;s attack deals extra damage (called &ldquo;precision damage&rdquo;) anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the medic flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 2nd level, and increases by 1d6 every three medic levels thereafter. Should the medic score a critical hit with a surgical precision, this extra damage is not multiplied. A medic may only use surgical precision with light piercing or slashing, melee weapons. This stacks with the thief&rsquo;s sneak attack and similar abilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"holistic-care\">Holistic Care (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Beginning of 2nd level, the medic is an expert in caring for her comrades both during and after battle. She makes sure they eat right, stretch, etc. Either way, she makes sure the group recovers as quickly as possible. The medic doubles the amount of hit points recovered per day naturally.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evasive\">Evasive (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, a medic is so skilled in combat involving light bladed or piercing weapons that, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the medic to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the medic to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels, to a maximum of +7 at 20th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evasion\">Evasion (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, a&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">medic</span>&nbsp;can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">medic</span>&nbsp;is wearing light armor, or no armor. A helpless&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">medic</span>&nbsp;(such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"battlefield-inspiration\">Battlefield Inspiration (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Out in the heat of battle, a medic may find themselves unable to reach allies who needs help. Even in such situations, however, a good speech, taunt, or shouted piece of advice can help their allies stay in one piece for a little bit longer. Starting at 3rd level, as a move action, the medic can grant herself and all allies within 30 feet a number of temporary hit points equal to the medic&rsquo;s level + her Wisdom modifier that lasts until the end of the encounter. All creatures to be affected must be able to see, hear, and understand the medic to gain the bonuses. This ability can be used once per encounter at 3rd level and she gains one additional use per encounter every three medic levels thereafter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emergency-team\">Emergency Team (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, the medic is skilled at working on and managing an emergency medical team. Allies automatically succeed on aid another attempts when assisting the medic with Heal checks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"combat-medic-technique\">Combat Medic Technique</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter until 9th level, the medic may select a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/thief/thief-talents/\">thief talent</a>. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a medic&rsquo;s surgical precision. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made. The medic counts her medic levels as thief levels for prerequisites for thief talents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"treatment\">Treatment (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, the medic can cure conditions and status effects. The medic can make a Heal check that takes a minute to cure the status. The medic can use Treatment as part of a triage as a free action, this bypasses the normal time it takes to perform a treatment.</p>\n<p>The medic can attempt a&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Heal</span>&nbsp;check to&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">cure</span>&nbsp;the condition. Conditions the medic can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Heal</span>&nbsp;DC (see below). The medic cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">medic</span>. Failure by 5 or less means the condition transfers to the medic for the rest of the duration or until cured. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the medic is as well for the remaining duration or until cured.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor Conditions (DC 15):&nbsp;Blinded, fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Major Conditions (DC 20):&nbsp;Dazed, diseased, enfeebled, silenced and staggered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Severe Conditions (DC 25):&nbsp;Confused, exhausted, frightened, immobilized, nauseated, poisoned, and slowed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dire Conditions (DC 30):&nbsp;B<span lang=\"en-US\">erserk</span>, deafened, disabled, paralyzed, petrified, stunned, and zombie.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the medic targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The medic cannot&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">cure conditions</span>&nbsp;on herself.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, the medic can use this ability to&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">heal</span>&nbsp;minor conditions without needing to attempt a&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Heal</span>&nbsp;check. She can&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">cure</span>&nbsp;major conditions without a roll at 9th level and can cure diseases (not just the condition) using a triage with a Heal check equal to double the Save DC of the disease, severe conditions at 13th level and can cure poisons (not just the condition) using a triage with a Heal check equal to double the Save DC of the poison, and dire conditions at 17th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"healing-hands\">Healing Hands (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 4th level, a medic may provide first aid to two people or treat two people for poison as a standard action (make a separate Heal check for each creature). When using the Heal skill to treat wounds from caltrops (and so on), treat deadly wounds, treat poison, treat disease, or treat long-term care, she may treat double the normal number of people she may treat at the same time. She may also provide long term care for herself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-recovery\">Improved Recovery (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, when the medic treats deadly wounds, the creature she treats recovers hit points and ability score damage as if it had rested for a full day and she no longer needs a healer&rsquo;s kit to perform these actions. At 7th level, the medic can treat deadly wounds or provide long term care to a number of creatures equal to her Wisdom modifier at the same time. In addition, when the medic treat deadly wounds, the creature recovers hit point and ability damage as if it had rested for a full day with long term care. At 11th level, when the medic treat deadly wounds, the creature recovers hit point and ability damage as if it had rested for 3 days.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uncanny-dodge\">Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">medic&nbsp;</span>can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">medic</span>&nbsp;with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her. If a&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">medic</span>&nbsp;already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"injections\">Injections (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Beginning of 5th level, the medic can prepare injections to enhance herself and her allies. The medic can prepare a number of injections equal to half her medic level + her Wisdom modifier per day. Most medics create a number of syringes at the start of the day equal to the total number of injections they can create in that day and takes an hour to prepare. The medic must pick specific injections (see below) during this time. All injections have a duration of 1 minute and become inert if not used during the day they were created. After the duration of the injections is over, the recipients are fatigued for twice the amount of time. If the recipient receives another injection while fatigued, they become exhausted instead. It takes a standard action to use, but the medic can hand out the injections.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adrenaline Shot (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection gains the Haste status effect.</li>\n<li>Feline Vision (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection gains low-<wbr />light vision and a +4 competence bonus to Perception skill checks.</li>\n<li>Mental Boost (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection gains a +2 alchemical bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</li>\n<li>Physical Boost (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection gains a +2 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.</li>\n<li>Regenerative Serum (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection gains Fast Healing 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"anesthetic\">Anesthetic</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, a medic learns how to supplement uses of the Heal skill with pain-<wbr />killing drugs. She gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/skill-focus-final/\">Skill Focus</a>&nbsp;(Heal) as a bonus feat. Any use of the Heal skill that has a risk of harming the patient (such as extracting a barb) only deals the minimum damage when performed by a medic. If the medic already has this feat, she may pick another Non-Combat feat for which she meets the prerequisites for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"expert-healer\">Improved Triage (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 7th level, the medic improves the speed of applying her triage ability from a standard action to a move action. She can also apply triage to multiple allies as a standard action instead of a full round action. In addition, the medic can apply the effect of two medical practices of her choice to any use of her Triage ability, she may apply the effect of a third medical practice at 12th level and a fourth at 17th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"precision-expertise\">Precision Expertise (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Also at 7th level, when the medic deals a surgical precision attack, she may sacrifice 1 die of damage to deal either 1 point of temporary Strength or Dexterity damage as a free action. This applies to a single attack and must be declared before the attack is rolled. The ability cannot be used to deal more than 6 points of ability damage on a single target. The ability damage lasts for 1 minute per medic level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"medical-alchemist\">Medical Alchemist (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 8th level, an accomplished medic does not need magic to create elixirs with miraculous healing capabilities. With a healer&rsquo;s kit, an alchemist&rsquo;s kit and rare herbs worth the cost of the alchemical item, the medic may create a non-<wbr />magical cure potion in 8 hours, using her medic level as the caster level and her Wisdom modifier for the spell&rsquo;s effect. At 12th level, she may create non-<wbr />magical hi-<wbr />potions. At 16th level, she may create non-<wbr />magical x-<wbr />potions. At 20th level, she may create non-<wbr />magical mega potions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"resuscitation\">Resuscitation (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, the medic&rsquo;s ability to treat severe wounds allows her to bring allies back from the very brink of death. The medic can use her triage ability to heal allies that have died within a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom modifier. If the healed creature&rsquo;s hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature&rsquo;s hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead. Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by resuscitation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-uncanny-dodge\">Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">medic</span>&nbsp;of 10th level can no longer be flanked; she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies creatures the flanking bonus by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more character levels than the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">medic</span>&nbsp;does.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-injections\">Improved Injections (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, the medic&rsquo;s knowledge of medical injections improves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adrenaline Shot (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection also gains an additional attack with a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty on all attack rolls.</li>\n<li>Feline Vision (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection also gains Darkvision (60 feet) and now gains a +8 competence bonus to Perception skill checks.</li>\n<li>Mental Boost (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection now gains a +4 alchemical bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</li>\n<li>Physical Boost (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection now gains a +4 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.</li>\n<li>Regenerative Serum (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection now gains Fast Healing 4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"quick-fix\">Quick Fix (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, as a standard action, the medic can cure 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to one of the subject&rsquo;s ability scores with successful Heal check (DC 25). This application of the skill can be used successfully on a character only once per injury.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-combat-medic-technique\">Advanced Combat Medic Technique</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 12th level, and every three levels thereafter, the medic may select an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/thief/thief-talents/\">advanced thief talent</a>. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a medic&rsquo;s surgical precision. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made. The medic counts her medic levels as thief levels for prerequisites for advanced thief talents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"therapy\">Therapy (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, the medic can cure 1 point of permanent ability damage to one of the subject&rsquo;s ability scores. This takes one month to heal. This is reduced by 1 day per each rank in the Heal skill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"penetrating-strike\">Penetrating Strike (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Also at 13th level, when the medic makes a surgical precision attack, she can bypass damage reduction equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-resuscitation\">Improved Resuscitation (Sp)</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, the medic&rsquo;s ability to stave off the death of her allies broaches on the supernatural. Once per day, she can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/r/raise\">raise</a>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. Her caster level for this effect equals her medic level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"superior-injections\">Superior Injections (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 15th level, the medic&rsquo;s knowledge of medical injections improves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adrenaline Shot (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection now gains a third additional attack with a &ndash;<wbr />4 penalty on all attack rolls.</li>\n<li>Feline Vision (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection now gains Darkvision (120 feet) and a +12 competence bonus to Perception skill checks.</li>\n<li>Mental Boost (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection now gains a +6 alchemical bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</li>\n<li>Physical Boost (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection now gains a +6 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.</li>\n<li>Regenerative Serum (Ex):&nbsp;The recipient of this injection now gains Fast Healing 6.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"formulating-solution\">Formulating Solution (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 16th level, the medic can take any injection she has created and create a mist that infects all creatures around her within 10 feet with the injection but the duration is halved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"perfect-body\">Perfect Body (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, a medic has mastered her own body, making her difficult to kill. As a full-<wbr />round action, the medic can harness her metabolism to heal herself and gaining Fast Healing 10 for 1 minute. The medic can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"greater-resuscitation\">Greater Resuscitation (Sp)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, the medic&rsquo;s skill at treating wounds is so great she can perform truly spectacular feats of medicine. Once per week, she can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/f/full-life\">full-life</a>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. Her caster level for this effect equals her medic level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"master-medic\">Master Medic (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, the medic is such an expert of the healing arts that she can apply any number of medical practices that she knows to her Triage ability.</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.

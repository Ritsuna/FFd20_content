### 0.1.0 WARNINGS and WORKAROUNDS

- Currently Limitbreaks are fussy, current workaround is to link it to the (floor((@attributes.hd.total +3)/4)) with charges but this can cause too many charges. please ask your players to remember this and not abuse it
- Materia exp is using the full value of combat exp gained, this is to reduce the amount of math the player needs to do. I don't know how exp distribution works so im not touching it yet.

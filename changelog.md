### WARNINGS and WORKAROUNDS
- Currently Limitbreaks are fussy, current workaround is to link it to the @attributes.limitbreak.max with charges but this can cause too many charges. please ask your players to remember this and not abuse it
- Materia exp is using the full value of combat exp gained, this is to reduce the amount of math the player needs to do. I dont know how exp distribution works so im not touching it yet.
